The ISO 646 character set (CCITT T.50 International Alphabet 5, American

DTE Command Lines</a>
</i></b></p>
A command line is a string of characters sent from a DTE to the DCE while the
DCE is in a command state. Command lines have a prefix, a body, and a
terminator. The prefix consists of the ASCII characters "AT" (065, 084) or "at"
(097, 116). The body is a string of commands restricted to printable ASCII
characters (032 - 126). Space characters (ASCII 032) and control characters
other than carriage return &lt;CR&gt; (default value = ASCII 013 = 0Dh, see
register S3), backspace &lt;BS&gt; (default value = ASCII 008 = 08h, see
register S5), and cancel &lt;cntrl-x&gt; (ASCII 024 = 18h) in the command
string are ignored. The default terminator is the &lt;CR&gt; character.
Characters that precede the AT prefix are ignored.

AT COMMAND GUIDELINES</a>
</b></p>
Modem operation is controlled by generic AT commands. These AT commands may be
basic AT (i.e., commands preceded by AT, AT&amp;, AT%, AT*, AT\, AT), AT-, or
AT#), S-Register (e.g., S6=n), Fax class 1 (e.g., +FTM), Fax class 2 (e.g.,
+FDCS:), or voice (e.g., #VBS) commands. The command syntax and operation
guidelines governing each of these command categories are described in
subsequent sections.

<p class="bodytext"><b><i>
<a name="RTFToC14">2.3.1
Basic Command Syntax</a>
</i></b></p>
Characters within the command line are parsed as commands with associated
parameter values. The basic commands consist of single ASCII characters, or
single characters preceded by a prefix character, followed by a decimal
parameter (e.g., "&amp;D1"). Missing decimal parameters are evaluated as 0.

The facsimile commands use extended syntax. They are preceded by the "+F"
characters, and they are terminated by the semicolon ":" character (ASCII 059)
or by the &lt;CR&gt; that terminates the command line.<p>

AT COMMAND GUIDELINES</a></a>
</a></b></p>
The basic AT commands used to control modem operation are defined in this
section. These commands are summarized in Appendix A. All these commands may
not be available in a specific product depending upon supported data rates and
modes. The default values are typical of a fully configured modem supporting
all data rates and options. The actual default value is dependent upon modem
firmware as defined by the firmware release notes.

<a name="RTFToC18">3.1.1
AT Commands, DTE Adaption</a>
</i></b></p>
Under AT operation, the serial interfaced modem performs an
autobaud/autoparity/autolength function on each AT header entered. The
autolength/autoparity facility can detect 7- or 8-bit characters of even, odd,
or no parity with one stop bit. This is not necessary for the parallel
interfaced modem since it has direct access to the UART registers.

AT Command Format</a>
</i></b></p>
A command line is a string of characters sent from a DTE to the modem (DCE)
while the modem is in a command state. A command line has a prefix, a body, and
a terminator. Each command line (with the exception of the A/ command) must
begin with the character sequence AT and must be terminated by a carriage
return. Commands entered in upper case or lower case are accepted, but both the
A and T must be of the same case, i.e., "AT" = ASCII 065, 084 or "at" = ASCII
097, 116. The body is a string of commands restricted to printable ASCII
characters (032 - 126). Space characters (ASCII 032) and control characters
other than CR (ASCII 013) and BS (ASCII 010) in the command string are ignored.
The default terminator is the ASCII &lt;CR&gt; character. Characters that
precede the AT prefix are ignored. The command line interpretation begins upon
receipt of the carriage return character.<p>
Characters within the command line are parsed as commands with associated
parameter values. The basic commands consist of single ASCII characters, or
single characters preceded by a prefix character (e.g., "&amp;"), followed by a
decimal parameter. Missing decimal parameters are evaluated as 0. <p>
The modem supports the editing of command lines by recognizing a backspace
character. When modem echo is enabled, the modem responds to receipt of a
backspace or delete by echoing a backspace character, a space character, and
another backspace. The hex value to be used for the backspace character is
programmable through register S5. Values equal to 0 or greater than 127, or the
value which corresponds to the carriage return character, cannot be used for
the backspace character. This editing is not applicable to the AT header of a
command. A command line may be aborted at any time by entering &lt; cntrl-x
&gt; (18h).<p>
The AT sequence may be followed by any number of commands in sequence, except
for commands such as Z, D, or A. Commands following commands Z, D, or A on the
same command line will be ignored. The maximum number of characters on any
command line is 39 (including "A" and "T"). If a syntax error is found anywhere
in a command line command, the remainder of the line will be ignored and the
ERROR result code will be returned.<p>
Most commands entered with parameters out of range will not be accepted and the
ERROR response will be returned to the DTE.<p>
Commands will only be accepted by the modem once the previous command has been
fully executed, which is normally indicated by the return of an appropriate
result code. Execution of commands D and A, either as a result of a direct
command or a re-execute command, will be aborted if another character is
entered before completion of the handshake.

Escape Code Sequence</a>
</i></b></p>
When the modem has established a connection and has entered on-line data mode,
it is possible to break into the data transmission in order to issue further
commands to the modem in an on-line command mode. This is achieved by the DTE
sending to the modem a sequence of three ASCII characters specified by register
S2. The default character is '+'. The maximum time allowed between receipt of
the last character of the three escape character sequence from the DTE and
sending of the OK result code to the DTE is controlled by the S12 register.<p>

The modem will go off-hook and attempt to answer an incoming call if correct
conditions are met. Upon successful completion of answer handshake, the modem
will go on-line in answer mode. This command may be affected by the state of
Line Current Sense, if enabled. (Most countries do not require Line Current

- Dial</a>
</i></p>
This command directs the modem to go on-line, dial according to the string
entered and attempt to establish a connection. If no dial string is supplied,
the modem will go on-line and attempt the handshake in originate mode. In
W-class models, the action of going off-hook is affected by the status of the
Line Current Sense input, if line current sensing is enabled, and by the
blacklist and delayed list. <b>NOTE:</b> If the ATD command is issued before
the S1 register has cleared, the modem will respond with the NO CARRIER result
code.<p>
If +FCLASS=0 is selected, the modem will behave as a data modem and will
attempt to connect to another data modem. The modem will have up to the period
of time specified by register S6 or S7 to wait for carrier and complete the
handshake. If this time expires before the modem can complete the handshake,
the modem will go on-hook with the NO CARRIER response. This command will be
aborted in progress upon receipt of any DTE character before completion of the
handshake.<p>
If +FCLASS=1 or 2 is selected, the modem will behave as a facsimile modem and
attempt to connect to a facsimile machine (or modem) by entering the HDLC V.21
channel 2 receive state (as if +FRH=3 had been issued). This command will be
aborted upon receipt of any DTE character if the modem has not finished
dialing. In this case, the modem will go on-hook and return to command mode
after displaying the NO CARRIER message. If the modem has finished dialing, it
proceeds as if the +FRH=3 command has been issued. (Refer to the +FRH command
to determine how the modem behaves following this stage.)<p>
Dial Modifiers. The valid dial string parameters are described below.
Punctuation characters may be used for clarity, with parentheses, hyphen, and
spaces being ignored.<p>
0-9	DTMF digits 0 to 9.<p>
*	The 'star' digit (tone dialing only).<p>
#	The 'gate' digit (tone dialing only).<p>
A-D	DTMF digits A, B, C, and D. Some countries may prohibit sending of these
digits during dialing.<p>
L	Re-dial last number: the modem will re-dial the last valid telephone number.
The L must be immediately after the D with all the following characters
ignored).<p>
P	Select pulse dialing: pulse dial the numbers that follow until a "T" is
encountered. Affects current and subsequent dialing. Some countries prevent
changing dialing modes after the first digit is dialed.<p>
T	Select tone dialing: tone dial the numbers that follow until a "P" is
encountered. Affects current and subsequent dialing. Some countries prevent
changing dialing modes after the first digit is dialed.<p>
R	This command will be accepted, but not acted on.<p>
S=n	Dial the number stored in the directory (n = 0 to 3). (See &amp;Z.)<p>
!	Flash: the modem will go on-hook for a time defined by the value of S29.
Country requirements may limit the time imposed.<p>
W	Wait for dial tone: the modem will wait for dial tone before dialing the
digits following "W". If dial tone is not detected within the time specified by
S7 (US) or S6 (W-class), the modem will abort the rest of the sequence, return
on-hook, and generate an error message.<p>
@	Wait for silence: the modem will wait for at least 5 seconds of silence in
the call progress frequency band before continuing with the next dial string
parameter. If the modem does not detect these 5 seconds of silence before the
expiration of the call abort timer (S7), the modem will terminate the call
attempt with a NO ANSWER message. If busy detection is enabled, the modem may
terminate the call with the BUSY result code. If answer tone arrives during
execution of this parameter, the modem handshakes.<p>
&amp;	Wait for credit card dialing tone before continuing with the dial string.
If the tone is not detected within the time specified by S7 (US models) or S6
(W-class models), the modem will abort the rest of the sequence, return
on-hook, and generate an error message.<p>
,	Dial pause: the modem will pause for a time specified by S8 before dialing
the digits following ",".<p>
;	Return to command state. Added to the end of a dial string, this causes the
modem to return to the command state after it processes the portion of the dial
string preceding the ";". This allows the user to issue additional AT commands
while remaining off-hook. The additional AT commands may be placed in the
original command line following the ";" and/or may be entered on subsequent
command lines. The modem will enter call progress only after an additional dial
command is issued without the ";" terminator. Use "H" to abort the dial in
progress, and go back on-hook.<p>
^	Toggles calling tone enable/disable: applicable to current dial attempt
only.<p>
( )	Ignored: may be used to format the dial string.<p>

This command selects which subset of the result messages will be used by the
modem to inform the DTE of the results of commands.<p>
Blind dialing is enabled or disabled by country parameters. If the user wishes
to enforce dial tone detection, a "W" can be placed in the dial string (see D
command). Note that the information below is based upon the default
implementation of the X results table. Table 3-1 indicates the messages which
are enabled for each X value.<p>
If the modem is in facsimile mode (+FCLASS=1 or 2), the only message sent to
indicate a connection is CONNECT without a speed indication.<p>
X0	Disables monitoring of busy tones unless forced otherwise by country
requirements; send only OK, CONNECT, RING, NO CARRIER, ERROR, and NO ANSWER
result codes. Blind dialing is enabled/disabled by country parameters. If busy
tone detection is enforced and busy tone is detected, NO CARRIER will be
reported. If dial tone detection is enforced or selected and dial tone is not
detected, NO CARRIER will be reported instead of NO DIAL TONE. The value 000b
is written to S22 bits 6, 5, and 4, respectively.<p>
X1	Disables monitoring of busy tones unless forced otherwise by country
requirements; send only OK, CONNECT, RING, NO CARRIER, ERROR, NO ANSWER, and
CONNECT XXXX (XXXX = rate). Blind dialing enabled/disabled by country
parameters. If busy tone detection is enforced and busy tone is detected, NO
CARRIER will be reported instead of BUSY. If dial tone detection is enforced or
selected and dial tone is not detected, NO CARRIER will be reported instead of
NO DIAL TONE. The value 100b is written to S22 bits 6, 5, and 4,
respectively.<p>
X2	Disables monitoring of busy tones unless forced otherwise by country
requirements; send only OK, CONNECT, RING, NO CARRIER, ERROR, NO DIALTONE, NO
ANSWER, and CONNECT XXXX. If busy tone detection is enforced and busy tone is
detected, NO CARRIER will be reported instead of BUSY. If dial tone detection
is enforced or selected and dial tone is not detected, NO DIAL TONE will be
reported instead of NO CARRIER. The value 101b is written to S22 bits 6, 5, and
4, respectively.<p>
X3	Enables monitoring of busy tones; send only OK, CONNECT, RING, NO CARRIER,
ERROR, NO ANSWER, and CONNECT XXXX. Blind dialing is enabled/disabled by
country parameters. If dial tone detection is enforced and dial tone is not
detected, NO CARRIER will be reported. The value 110b is written to S22 bits 6,
5, and 4, respectively.<p>
X4	Enables monitoring of busy tones; send all messages. The value 111b is
written to S22 bits 6, 5, and 4, respectively. (Default.)<p>
Result Codes:<p>
OK	n = 0 to 4.<p>
ERROR	Otherwise.

This command determines the DTR operating mode. The modem treats the &amp;M
command as a subset of the &amp;Q command.<p>
&amp;M0	Selects direct asynchronous operation. Note that the command sequence
&amp;M0\N0 selects normal buffered mode, but the command sequence \N0&amp;M0
selects direct mode. This is because the \N0 command is analogous to the

&amp;M2	Selects synchronous connect mode with async off-line command mode. Same
as &amp;M1 except that &amp;M2 enables DTR dialing of directory slot 0. The
modem will disconnect if DTR is OFF for more than the period in S25 (in units
of hundredths of a second): the data connection will be synchronous. The value
010b is written to S27 bits 3, 1, and 0, respectively. (Serial interface
operation only.)<p>
&amp;M3	Selects synchronous connect mode. This mode allows DTR to act as a
talk/data switch. The call is manually initiated while DTR is inactive. When
DTR becomes active, the handshake proceeds in originate or answer mode
according to S14 bit 7. The value 011b is written to S27 bits 3, 1, and 0,

This command is an extension of the &amp;M command and is used to control the

see \N.) <p>
<b>NOTE:</b> When the &amp;Q0 to &amp;Q4 command is issued to select the mode,
the subsequent connect message will report the DCE speed regardless of the W
command and S95 settings.<p>
&amp;Q0	Selects direct asynchronous operation. The value 000b is written to S27
bits 3, 1, and 0, respectively. See &amp;M0.<p>
&amp;Q1	Selects synchronous connect mode with async off-line command mode. The
value 001b is written to S27 bits 3, 1, and 0, respectively. See &amp;M1.
(Serial interface operation only.)<p>
&amp;Q2	Selects synchronous connect mode with async off-line command mode and
enables DTR dialing of directory 0. The value 010b is written to S27 bits 3, 1,
and 0, respectively. See &amp;M2. (Serial interface operation only.)<p>
&amp;Q3	Selects synchronous connect mode with async off-line command mode and
enables DTR to act as Talk/Data switch. The value 011b is written to S27 bits
3, 1, and 0, respectively. See &amp;M3. (Serial interface operation only.)<p>
&amp;Q4	Selects AutoSync operation. The value 100b is written to S27 bits 3, 1,
and 0, respectively. <p>
	AutoSync operation, when used in conjunction with the Hayes Synchronous
Interface (HSI) capability in the DTE, provides synchronous communication
capability from an asynchronous terminal. <p>
	<b>Starting AutoSync.</b> Set registers S19, S20, and S25 to the desired
values before selecting AutoSync operation with &amp;Q4. After the CONNECT
message is issued, the modem waits the period of time specified by S25 before
examining DTR. If DTR is on, the modem enters the synchronous operating state;
if DTR is off, the modem terminates the line connection and returns to the
asynchronous command state.<p>
	<b>Stopping AutoSync. </b>AutoSync operation is stopped upon loss<b> </b>of
carrier or the on-to-off transition of DTR. Loss of carrier will cause the
modem to return to the asynchronous command state. An on-to-off transition of
DTR will cause the modem to return to the asynchronous command state and either
not terminate the line connection (&amp;D1 active) or terminate the line
connection (any other &amp;Dn command active).<p>
&amp;Q5	The modem will try to negotiate an error-corrected link. The modem can
be configured using S36 to determine whether a failure will result in the modem
returning on-hook or will result in fallback to an asynchronous connection. The
value 101b is written to S27 bits 3, 1, and 0, respectively. (Default.)<p>
&amp;Q6	Selects asynchronous operation in normal mode (speed buffering). The
value 110b is written to S27 bits 3, 1, and 0, respectively.<p>

&amp;T7	Requests a remote digital loopback (RDL),V.54 Loop 2, with self test.
(In self test, a test pattern is looped back and checked by the modem.) If no
connection exists, ERROR is returned. When the test is terminated either via
expiration of S18, or via the &amp;T0 or H command, the number of detected
errors is reported to the DTE. Sets S16 bit 5 when the test is in progress.<p>
&amp;T8	Initiates local analog loopback, V.54 Loop 3, with self test. (In self

- Select Modulation</a></a>
</a></i></p>
This extended-format command selects the modulation, optionally enables or
disables automode, and optionally specifies the lowest and highest connection
rates using one to four subparameters. The command format is:<p>
+MS= &lt;mod&gt;
[,[&lt;automode&gt;][,[&lt;min_rate&gt;][,[&lt;max_rate&gt;]]]]&lt;CR&gt;<p>
<b>Notes:</b><p>
1.	For 14400 bps and lower speeds, the Nn command and S37 register can
alternatively be used, in which case the +MS subparameters will modified to
reflect the Nn and S37=x settings. Use of the Nn and S37=x commands is not
recommended but is provided for compatibility with existing communication
software. (S37 is not updated by the +MS command.)<p>
2.	Subparameters not entered (enter a comma only or &lt;CR&gt; to skip the last
subparameter) remain at their current values.

Notes: 1. See optional &lt;automode&gt;, &lt;min_rate&gt;, and &lt;max_rate&gt; subparameters. 2.           
For V.23, originating modes transmit at 75 bps and receive at 1200 bps; answering         
modes transmit at 1200&nbsp;bps and receive at 75 bps. The rate is always specified as         
1200 bps.                                                                                 

</pre>

The modem may also automatically switch to another modulation (automode),
subject to the following constraints:<p>
a.	The modem may not be able to automatically switch from the current
modulation (specified by &lt;mod&gt;) to some other modulation. For example,
there is no standard way to automode from Bell 103 to V.23.<p>
b.	The DTE may disable automode operation (see &lt;automode&gt; below).<p>
c.	The DTE may constrain the range of modulations available by specifying the
lowest and highest rates (see &lt;min_rate&gt; and &lt;max_rate&gt; below).<p>
2.	&lt;automode&gt; is an optional numeric value which enables or disables
automatic modulation negotiation using V.8 or V.32 bis Annex A. The options are:

<pre>
 &lt;automode&gt;   Option Selected                                        Notes          
           0  Automode disabled                                                     
           1  Automode enabled using V.8 or V.32 Annex A             Default        

</pre>
<p>
The default value is 1, which enables automode. Note, however, there are
modulations for which there is no automatic negotiation, e.g., Bell 212
(&lt;mod&gt; = 69).<p>
<b>For &lt;automode&gt; = 0 (automode disabled, i.e., fixed modulation):</b><p>
a.	If &lt;max_rate&gt; is within the rates supported by the selected
modulation, the selected rate is that specified by &lt;max_rate&gt;. For
example:<p>
	+MS=10,0,1200,4800 selects V.32 bis 4800 bps fixed rate.<p>
b.	If &lt;max_rate&gt; is greater than the highest speed supported by the
modulation specified by &lt;mod&gt;, the starting rate is the highest rate
supported by the selected modulation. For example:<p>
	+MS=10,0,2400,14400 selects V.32 bis 14400, 12000, 9600, 7200, or 4800 bps.<p>
c.	To emulate issuance of the N0S37=x command sequence to select fixed mode
operation, specify the &lt;max_rate&gt; and &lt;min_rate&gt; both to be the
(same) requested speed, and &lt;mod&gt; to be the modulation for that speed.
For example:<p>
	+MS=11,0,16800,16800 selects V.34 16800 bps fixed mode (no comparable S37
command).<p>
	+MS=10,0,12000,12000 selects V.32 bis 12000 bps fixed mode (same as
N0S37=10).<p>
<b>For &lt;automode&gt; = 1 (automode enabled, i.e., automatically selected
speed and modulation): </b><p>
The modem connects at the highest possible rate in accordance with V.8,
or V.32 bis Annex A if V.8 is not supported by the remote modem. <p>
a.	If &lt;max_rate&gt; is greater than the highest rate supported by the
modulation specified by &lt;mod&gt;, the modem automodes down from the highest
rate of the selected modulation. For example:<p>
	+MS=10,1,1200,24000 selects automoding down from V.32 bis 14400 bps. <p>
b.	To emulate issuance of the N1S37=x sequence command, specify the modulation
and the rate to start automoding down from using &lt;mod&gt; and
&lt;max_rate&gt;, respectively. Set &lt;min_rate&gt; to 300 to allow automoding
all the way down to V.21 300 bps. For example:<p>
	+MS=11,1,300,16800 selects automode starting at V.34 16800 bps (no comparable
S37 command).<p>
	+MS=9,1,300,12000 selects automode starting at V.32 bis 12000 bps (same as
N1S37=10).<p>
3.	&lt;min_rate&gt; is an optional number which specifies the lowest rate at
which the modem may establish a connection. The value is decimal coded, in
units of bps, e.g., 2400 specifies the lowest rate to be 2400 bps. The default
is 300 for 300&nbsp;bps.<p>
4.	&lt;max_rate&gt; is an optional number which specifies the highest rate at
which the modem may establish a connection. The value is decimal coded, in
units of bps, e.g., 14400 specifies the highest rate to be 14400 bps. The
default is 28800 for 28800 bps.

CELLULAR COMMANDS</a>
</b></p>
The Direct Connect Modem allows a direct interface to most cellular telephones
eliminating the need for other intelligent interfaces. <p>
Landline modems operate with the telephone system by either going off hook
detecting dialtone and the dialing the telephone number using pulses or DTMF
digits, or detecting the RING signal and answering the call. Intelligent
cellular phone interfaces connect between the modems RJ-11 socket and the
cellular phone's data interface. The interface provides landline features to
the modem (line current, dial tone, ringing, etc.), and translates the modem's
signals (off hook, DTMF digits, etc.) into signals that the cellular phone
understands. Once connected the interface acts as a transparent link between
the modem and the cellular telephone.<p>
The Direct Connect Modem interfaces directly to the cellular phone's data
interface and provides direct control over the cellular phones operation. For
example if the user were to instruct the modem to dial using the ATDTnnnn
command the modem would relay the telephone number and the SEND command to the
cellular phone over the data interface.<p>
The modem connects to the cellular phone using a special cable which must be
purchased separately. A different cable is required for each cellular phone or
make of cellular phones. Below is a block diagram of a typical Direct Connect
Cellular Modem (based on AK14-X270 Rev 4 reference schematic).

<a name="RTFToC111">3.7.1
Cellular Phone Drivers</a>
</i></b></p>
The data interface to cellular phones differs between manufacturers and models
and requires a unique cellular phone driver for each phone or group of phones.
Therefore the particular phone driver needs to be downloaded from the PC into
the modem's RAM before the modem can be used directly with the cellular phone.
If a driver is not loaded the modem will operate as a normal landline modem.

<a name="RTFToC116">Application
of ^T6 Status Byte
</a></h5>
The information obtained by issuing a AT^T6 can be used to determine if the
loading of the cellular phone driver is necessary by the host software. A
download is not necessary if landline (or no cable) is connected to the modem,
in which ^T6 will return a value of 0 (bit 7=0). A download is necessary when a
cellular cable is detected (implied cellular phone is also connected), in which
^T6 will return a value of 128 (bit 7=1). Once a driver is downloaded to the
modem, it will be able to operate in landline or cellular mode based on
detection of a cellular cable.

Operation</a>
</i></b></p>
Once the driver is loaded and the modem is connected to the cellular phone, and
the phone is powered on dial/answer functions will be routed through the phone
instead of the landline DAA, i.e., no special commands are needed to place or
answer calls, the same AT commands and software packages that are used for
landline communication sessions can be used. If the cellular phone is not
connected or is powered off dial/answer functions will be routed through the
landline DAA, and if V.42 bis connection is established the cellular phone
driver will be purged so that the V.42 bis dictionaries can be increased to
their normal size.<p>
While the modem is being used with a cellular phone it will respond with normal
result messages with the following differences in meaning:<p>
NO DIALTONE	Indicates that cellular service is not currently available.<p>
RING	Indicates that the cellular phone is receiving an incoming call.

<a name="RTFToC118">Modem
Configuration</a>
</i></p>
Modem performance will be improved by modification of your standard
configuration; it is recommended that the landline modem also be EC compatible
for reliable communications.<p>
Cell Site	AT&amp;F<p>
Base Site	AT&amp;F -SEC=1,18<p>
MNP10-EC is automatically enabled on the cell side when a cellular phone driver
is loaded and the modem firmware detects that the cellular phone is attached,
also in the V.34 products the modem is automatically configured to force the
connection in V.32bis mode.<p>
On the cell side the transmit level is defined in the cellular driver,
therefore it is not necessary to set the level using the AT-SEC command.<p>
In the V.34 products on the landline side if MNP10-EC is disabled (AT-SEC=0),
it will automatically be enabled if another V.34 modem is calling (V.8 signal
indicates cellular capability). No particular modulation will be chosen on the
land line side. Therefore if a landside V.34 modem is NOT going to receive any
calls from a V.32bis MNP10-EC modem it can be configured using AT&amp;F
-SEC=0,18 , otherwise use the configuration above.<p>
In V.34 modems if MNP10-EC is enabled manually (using AT-SEC=1) no particular
modulation will be chosen, therefore if the user wishes to force V.32bis
modulation they should use the AT+MS=10,1,minspeed,maxspeed command (e.g.
AT+MS=10,1,4800,12000 would force V.32bis and limit the speed between 4800 and
12000 bps). To allow V.34 modulation use AT+MS=11,1,minspeed,maxspeed (e.g.
AT+MS=11,1,4800,19200 would allow V.34 speeds between 4800 and 19200).<p>
When MNP10-EC is enabled in V.34 modes the symbol rate is limited to 3000,
therefore the maximum speed would be 26.4K however the initial connect speed is
limited to 21600.<p>
If an AXCELL(TM) solution is used, a transmit level of -10dBm is required,
therefore the following init string should be used:<p>
Cell Site	AT &amp;F -SEC=1,10<p>
It is recommended that systems be set up if possible with separate modems to
receive calls from other land based modems and cellular modems. This is so that
land based users that experience high network attenuation do not have
connection problems when communicating to modems configured for cellular
operation.<p>
The above configurations are the minimum additional AT commands may be issued
to change the result messages etc, AT&amp;F is used to ensure that the modem is
in a know state.<p>
Table 3-2 summarizes the mode and resulting transmit levels for both modems
depending on their configuration.
<a name="_Toc347715548"></a>
<p class="bodytext"><i>
<a name="RTFToC119">Fax
Configuration</a>
</i></p>
It is recommended that fax transmissions be configured to operate at  9600 bps
in V.17 mode or 7200 bps in V.29 mode.
<a name="_Toc347715549"></a>
<p class="bodytext"><i>
<a name="RTFToC120">Cellular
Phone Configuration</a>
</i></p>
To achieve the best operational performance, a cellular data connection should
be attempted in a location where adequate signal strength is observed for the
cellular phone. This condition can be easily monitored on some phones with
signal strength indicator. In locations where even voice calls are unreliable,
data connections should not be attempted.  Under some circumstances a special
high gain antenna may improve performance.<p>
Additional information regarding the use of the cellular phone and cellular
network should be obtained from the service provider and or cellular phone
manufacturer.

AT COMMAND RESULT CODES</a>
</b></p>
The modem responds to commands from the DTE and to activity on the line by
signalling to the DTE in the form of result codes. The result codes that the
modem can send are described below.<p>
Two forms of each result code are available: long-form, an English-like
"verbose" response, and short-form, a data-like numeric response (included in
parentheses following the long-form). The long-form code is preceded and
terminated by the sequence &lt; CR&gt; &lt; LF&gt;. The short-form is
terminated by &lt; CR&gt;, only with no preceding sequence.<p>
If result messages are suppressed, nothing is returned to the DTE. The
long-form results codes can be modified by the OEM through the ConfigurACE
Configuration Utility Program. (See ConfigurACE description.)

<p class="bodytext"><i>
<a name="RTFToC123">CONNECT</a>
(1)
</i></p>
The modem will send this result code upon connecting when:<p>
1.	The line speed is 300 bps and the modem has been instructed to report the
line speed to the DTE upon connecting, or<p>
2.	The DTE speed is 300 bps and the modem has been instructed to report the DTE
speed to the DTE upon connecting, or<p>
3.	The range of result code responses is restricted by the X command such that
no speed reporting is allowed.

<p class="bodytext"><i>
<a name="RTFToC124">RING</a>
(2)
</i></p>
The modem sends this result code when incoming ringing is detected on the line.
What qualifies as a ring signal is determined by country-dependent parameters,
modifiable through ConfigurACE.<p>
When cellular interface is selected, RING indicates that the cellular phone is
receiving an incoming call.

CARRIER</a> (3)
</i></p>
The modem sends this result code when attempting to establish a call if:<p>
1.	Ringback is detected and later ceases but no carrier is detected within the
period of time determined by register S7, or<p>
2.	No ringback is detected within the period of time determined by register
S7.<p>
This result code is also used when the modem auto-disconnects due to loss of
carrier.<p>
Under X0, if busy tone detection is enforced, this result code is used as a
response to the detection of busy or circuit busy. Under X0, if dial tone
detection is enforced or selected, this result code is used to indicate that
dial tone has not been detected.

</i></p>
The modem returns this result code if the command line contains a syntax error
or it is unable to execute a command contained in the command line. It is
issued if a command does not exist or if the parameter supplied is outside the
permitted range.<p>
Under X0, X1, X2, and X3, this result is used instead of DELAYED and BLACKLISTED.

</p>
The S-Registers are summarized in Table 4-1 along with their default values;
registers denoted with an '*' may be stored in one of the two user profiles by
entering the &amp;Wn command. One of these profiles may be loaded at any time
by using the Zn command. Registers or register fields quoted as "reserved" are
reserved for current or future use by the firmware, or are permanently
overridden by PTT limitations. For the latter, control of the equivalent
functionality is available with ConfigurACE Call Progress and Blacklisting
options. <p>
All bit-mapped registers are read-only. The appropriate AT command which
controls the relevant bits in the S-Register should be used to change the value.

<p class="bodytext"><b>
<a name="RTFToC178">4.1
FACTORY DEFAULTS</a>
</b></p>
The factory default values are stored in ROM and are loaded into the active
configuration at power up or by the ATZn command. In addition, the designated
default profile is subsequently loaded, and may change some of the factory
default values. The designated default profile can be changed by entering the
&amp;Yn command where n is one of the two possible user profiles.<p>
The defaults shown are those used by Rockwell in factory profiles zero and one.
These may be overwritten by the OEM with ConfigurACE prior to placing the
firmware in PROM. Minimum and maximum values may also be imposed by ConfigurACE
in response to country PTT requirements.<p>
The default values shown in Table 4-1 may vary by modem firmware configuration.
Consult the MCU firmware release notes for exact configuration.<p>
The factory default values may be loaded at any time by entering the &amp;Fn
command.

Fax Origination</a>

Origination of fax calls is made using the ATD command. Upon completion of the
dial function, a calling tone at 1100 Hz is transmitted, with a cadence of 0.5
seconds on and 3 seconds off. The modem automatically enters mode +FRH=3 and
sends the CONNECT message to the DTE when FSK flags are detected from the remote.

Fax Answering</a>

Answering of fax calls is identical to answering of data calls with the
exception that the modem enters the fax handshaking mode instead of the data
handshaking mode after going off-hook. If +FAE=0, the modem, after sending
answer tone, automatically enters fax mode (+FTH=3), sends the CONNECT message
to the DTE, and starts sending FSK flags. If +FAE=1, the modem determines
whether the caller is a data modem or fax modem and sends the DATA or FAX
result code, respectively, to the DTE.

<p class="bodytext"><b><i>
<a name="RTFToC235">5.1.6
Fax Control Transmission</a>
</i></b></p>
Fax control transmission is initiated by the +FTH=n command. After this command
is issued, the modem generates the CONNECT message and transmits carrier in the
modulation scheme specified by the parameter n. The modem then transmits HDLC
flags for a minimum of 1 second. The modem continues to transmit the HDLC flags
until it receives a character from the DTE.<p>
When characters are received from the DTE, the modem adds start and end flags,
performs zero-bit insertion, generates FCS, and deletes &lt;DLE&gt;&lt;chr&gt;
character pairs before transmitting the characters to the remote fax machine.
Each &lt;DLE&gt;&lt;DLE&gt; sequence is transmitted as a single &lt;DLE&gt;.
&lt;DLE&gt;&lt;ETX&gt; is considered as the end of frame marker and is not
transmitted. All data received from the DTE after &lt;DLE&gt;&lt;ETX&gt; is
ignored by the modem until the modem generates either the CONNECT, OK, or ERROR
result code.<p>
If no more data is in the transmit buffer and the final bit was a 1 (bit 4 of
the second byte received from the DTE), the modem generates the OK result code
and returns to the command mode. If the final bit was a 0, the modem generates
the CONNECT message and waits for further data from the DTE while transmitting
HDLC flags. If no more data is received before 5 seconds elapse, the modem
drops carrier, goes on-hook, and generates the ERROR result code.

<p class="bodytext"><b><i>
<a name="RTFToC236">5.1.7
Fax Control Reception</a>
</i></b></p>
Fax control reception is initiated using the AT+FRH=n command. After this
command is issued, the modem looks for carrier in the modulation scheme
specified by the parameter n. If no carrier is detected before the period of
time specified by register S7 expires, the modem generates the NO CARRIER
message and returns to command mode. If a carrier is detected that is not the
one specified by the parameter n, the modem generates the +FCERROR message and
returns to the command mode. If the specified carrier is detected, the modem
generates the CONNECT message and enters the HDLC receive mode.<p>
In HDLC receive mode, the modem receives HDLC frames from the remote fax
machine, strips the flags, performs zero-bit deletion, performs error checking,
and handles &lt;DLE&gt;&lt;chr&gt; character pairs before passing the data to
the DTE. The modem prefixes each &lt;DLE&gt; character with another &lt;DLE&gt;
character before sending it to the DTE. After the last byte in the frame, the
modem sends &lt;DLE&gt;&lt;ETX&gt; to the DTE marking the end of the frame. The
modem then generates either the OK message if no errors were detected or the
ERROR message if errors were detected (FCS is incorrect), and returns to
command mode.<p>
While in command mode, the modem continues to receive data in the selected
modulation scheme, and sends the data after sending the CONNECT message to the
DTE when the DTE reissues the +FRH command with the same parameter. If the DTE
issues the +FRH command with a different parameter, the modem clears all
buffers and proceeds as described previously.<p>
If carrier is lost while in command mode and the DTE reissues the +FRH command
with the same parameter, and there is no data in the buffer, the modem sends
the ERROR result code to the DTE and returns to the command mode. If there is
data in the buffer, the modem sends the next frame of buffered data to the DTE,
followed by &lt;DLE&gt;&lt;ETX&gt;, and either the ERROR result code if errors
were detected or the OK result code if no errors were detected. The modem then
returns to command mode.<p>
The modem concludes an error is detected if carrier is lost for any period of
time during or before the reception of a frame. If carrier is lost for a time
period longer than the time specified by the register S10, the modem finishes
delivering the data in the receive buffer (if any) to the DTE, sends
&lt;DLE&gt;&lt;ETX&gt;, generates the ERROR message, and returns to command
mode. All subsequent data received from the remote is discarded.<p>
If the modem detects a frame abort sequence (seven consecutive ones with no
zero insertion) while it is waiting for a frame beginning flag (it was
receiving HDLC flags), it will wait for the HDLC flags again until either
carrier is lost, or the DTE aborts the process by sending an abort character or
by dropping DTR with &amp;D2 in effect. If the frame abort sequence is detected
while the modem is receiving a frame it finishes delivering the data in the
receive buffer (if any) to the DTE, sends &lt;DLE&gt;&lt;ETX&gt;, generates the
ERROR message, and returns to command mode. The modem keeps looking for HDLC
flags followed by more data from the remote, with the selected modulation
scheme.<p>
If the modem detects a receive buffer overflow condition, it concludes that
there was an FCS error in that frame. The modem will receive more frames only
if a starting flag is detected and there is room in the receive buffer. If a
starting flag is detected and there is no room in the buffer, the modem
discards all data in that frame.<p>
If the modem receives any character from the DTE after the +FRH command (except
flow control characters if software flow control is in effect), or if the modem
detects a high-to-low transition of the DTR signal while &amp;D1 is in effect,
it sends &lt;DLE&gt;&lt;ETX&gt; to the DTE, generates OK result code, and
returns to command mode. The receive buffer is cleared and all data received
from the remote is discarded. If the modem detects a DTR drop while &amp;D2 is
in effect, it goes on-hook, sends &lt;DLE&gt;&lt;ETX&gt; to the DTE, generates
OK result code, and returns to command mode. If the modem detects a DTR drop
while &amp;D3 is in effect, the modem performs a warm reset.

Fax Data Transmission</a>
</i></b></p>
Fax data transmission is initiated by the AT+FTM=n command. After this command
is issued, the modem generates the CONNECT message and transmits carrier in the
modulation scheme specified by the parameter n. The modem then transmits
constant 1 bits for a minimum of one second and continues to transmit constant
1 bits until it receives a character from the DTE.<p>
When data is received from the DTE, the modem deletes start and stop bits and
deletes all &lt;DLE&gt;&lt;chr&gt; character pairs before transmitting the data
to the remote. Each &lt;DLE&gt;&lt;DLE&gt; sequence is transmitted as a single
&lt;DLE&gt;. &lt;DLE&gt;&lt;ETX&gt; is considered as the end of stream marker,
and is not transmitted. All data received from the DTE after the
&lt;DLE&gt;&lt;ETX&gt; is ignored by the modem until the modem generates either
the CONNECT, OK, or ERROR result code.<p>
If no more data is in the transmit buffer, and the last transmitted character
was not an ASCII NULL, the modem generates the OK result code and returns to
the command mode. If the last character transmitted was an ASCII NULL, the
modem generates the CONNECT message to the DTE and waits for further data from
the DTE while transmitting NULLs to the remote. If more data is received before
five seconds elapse, the modem continues to transmit the data as described in
the previous paragraph. If five seconds elapse and no data is received from the
DTE, the modem drops carrier, goes on-hook, and generates the ERROR result code.

Fax Data Reception</a>
</i></b></p>
Fax data reception is initiated using the AT+FRM=n command. After this command
is issued, the modem looks for carrier in the modulation scheme specified by
the parameter n. If no carrier is detected before the period of time specified
by register S7 expires, the modem generates the NO CARRIER message and returns
to command mode. If a V.21 carrier is detected when a high speed carrier is
expected, the modem generates the +FCERROR message and returns to the command
mode. If the specified carrier is detected, the modem generates the CONNECT
message and enters the data receive mode.<p>
While in data receive mode, the modem receives data from the remote, adds start
and stop bits, and handles &lt;DLE&gt;&lt;chr&gt; character pairs before
passing the data to the DTE. The modem prefixes each &lt;DLE&gt; character with
another &lt;DLE&gt; character before sending it to the DTE.<p>
If the modem detects a receive buffer overflow condition, it stops receiving
from the remote until there is room in the receive buffer. The modem informs
the DTE of the buffer overflow after it sends to the DTE the last character
that was stored in the buffer before the overflow occurred.<p>
If the modem receives any character from the DTE after the +FRM command (except
flow control characters if software flow control is in effect), or if the modem
detects a high-to-low transition of the DTR signal while &amp;D1 is in effect,
it sends &lt;DLE&gt;&lt;ETX&gt; to the DTE, generates the OK result code, and
returns to command mode. The receive buffer is cleared and all data received
from the remote is discarded. If loss of DTR is detected while &amp;D2 is in
effect, the modem goes on-hook, sends &lt;DLE&gt;&lt;ETX&gt; followed by OK
result code to the DTE, and returns to command mode. If the modem detects a DTR
drop while &amp;D3 is in effect, the modem performs a warm reset.

The fax class 2 commands are summarized in Table 6-1.

DTE Commands</a></a>
</a></i></b></p>
The ISO 646 character set (CCITT T.50 International Alphabet 5, American
Standard Code for Information Interchange) is used for the issuance of commands
and responses. Only the low-order 7 bits of each character are used for
commands or parameters; the high order bit is ignored. Upper case characters
are equivalent to lower case characters.<p>
For Phase C data transmission or reception, all 8 bits are needed.

<p class="bodytext"><i>
<a name="RTFToC254">DTE
Command Lines</a>
</i></p>
A command line is a string of characters sent from a DTE to the modem (DCE)
while the modem is in a command state. A command line has a prefix, a body, and
a terminator. Each command line (with the exception of the A/ command) must
begin with the character sequence AT and must be terminated by a carriage
return. Commands entered in upper case or lower case are accepted, but both the
A and T must be of the same case, i.e., "AT" = ASCII 065, 084 or "at" = ASCII
097, 116. The body is a string of commands restricted to printable ASCII
characters (032 - 126). Space characters (ASCII 032) and control characters
other than CR (ASCII 013) and BS (ASCII 010) in the command string are ignored.
The default terminator is the ASCII &lt;CR&gt; character. Characters that
precede the AT prefix are ignored. The command line interpretation begins upon
receipt of the carriage return character.
<a name="_Toc343068431"></a><a name="_Toc347715684"></a>
<p class="bodytext"><i>
<a name="RTFToC255">Facsimile
Command Syntax</a>
</i></p>
After the "AT" or "at" prefix, facsimile commands use extended syntax. Each
command is preceded by the "+F" character and consists of single characters and
a decimal parameter (if applicable) terminated by the semicolon ":" character
(ASCII 059) or by the &lt;CR&gt; that terminated the command line. A missing
decimal parameter is evaluated as 0. <p>
For example, the command to instruct the modem to automatically answer a data
or fax call and also enable reception is:<p>
AT+FAE=0; +FCR 1 &lt;CR&gt;<p>
Basic data mode and fax service class mode select commands are:<p>
AT+FCLASS=0 &lt;CR&gt;	for Data Mode<p>
AT+FCLASS=1 &lt;CR&gt;	for Service Class 1 Fax<p>
AT+FCLASS=2 &lt;CR&gt;	for Service Class 2 Fax<p>
In Class 2, the DCE makes and terminates calls, manages the communication
session and negotiates (T.30 protocol) and transports the image date to DTE.
The T.4 protocol management of image data, etc., is done by DTE.<p>
The response to <p>
AT+FCLASS= 0&lt;CR&gt;	in Data Mode<p>
or<p>
AT+FCLASS=2&lt;CR&gt;	in Service Class 2 Fax<p>
is<p>
OK<p>
The service class may be set by the DTE from the choices available using the
"+FCLASS=&lt;VALUE&gt;" command.<p>
General Rules<p>
1.	+Fnnn commands must be entered completely, otherwise an ERROR response is
sent.<p>
2.	All response messages are preceded and followed by &lt;CR&gt;&lt;LF&gt;.
Multiple response commands (e.g., +FDIS: +FCSI: and +FDCS:) will, therefore,
appear to a have a blank line between them.<p>
3.	Fax Class 2 commands can be separated by the ":" character. The ";"
character can be omitted if desired. Note that non-data commands cannot be
separated by the ";" which is allowed as a dial modifier. <p>

<a name="RTFToC256">6.1.2
Serial Port Speed and Flow Control</a>
</i></b></p>
During fax mode, the DTE-DCE port speed is 19200 bps.<p>
The DCE provides a speed buffer of 1024 bytes and provides the DC1/DC3
(XON/XOFF) or RTS/CTS method of controlling the data into the buffer. This flow
control is controlled by the &amp;K3 or &amp;K4 command.<p>
This method of data flow control is available only for DTE to DCE direction of
data. There is no provision for data flow control from DCE to DTE.

<a name="RTFToC257">Data
Stream Termination</a>
</i></p>
The DCE exchanges streams of data with the DTE while executing data transfer
commands. These data streams use the termination described in Section 3.2/ISO
2111.<p>
The ASCII &lt;DLE&gt; character (016) is used as a special character to shield
special characters. The &lt;DLE&gt;&lt;ETX&gt; character pair
(&lt;106&gt;&lt;003&gt;) is used to mark the end of a stream. The following
patterns are used:<p>
any data...&lt;DLE&gt;&lt;ETX&gt;	end of stream<p>
any data...&lt;DLE&gt;&lt;DLE&gt;	single &lt;DLE&gt; in data<p>
any data...&lt;DLE&gt;&lt;any byte&gt;	delete &lt;DLE&gt;&lt;any byte&gt;

<p class="bodytext"><i>
<a name="RTFToC258">DTE
to DCE Streams</a>
</i></p>
The DCE filters the data stream from the DTE, and removes all character pairs
beginning with &lt;DLE&gt;. The DCE recognizes &lt;DLE&gt;&lt;ETX&gt; as the
stream terminator. The DCE recognizes &lt;DLE&gt;&lt;DLE&gt; and reinserts a
single &lt;DLE&gt; in its place.<p>
The DTE must filter stream data to the DCE, and insert extra &lt;DLE&gt;
characters ahead of data.

ATD, Originate a Call</a>
</i></b></p>
Syntax:	ATD....&lt;CR&gt;<p>
The DCE can support a DTE command to originate a call using the ATD command
(see Section 3.2).<p>
If this command is unsuccessful, the DCE reports an appropriate failure or
error type result code such as NO CARRIER, NO DIALTONE, or BUSY (see Section
3.3).<p>
If this call is successful, the typical DCE response is:<p>
ATDnn..nn	(go off-hook, dial, get CED)<br>+FCON	(DCE detects
flags)<br>[+FCSI:&lt;remote ID string&gt;]<br>+FDCS:&lt;T.30 subparameter
string&gt;<br>OK<p>
The DCE dials, detects call progress, and generates the CNG tone. It then waits
for a DIS frame. On detection of the first Phase B preamble (V.21 ch. 2
modulated by 300 bps HDLC flags), it reports the "+FCON" message to the DTE.
The DCE then switches to 19200 bps.<p>
The DCE generates a DCS frame based on the received DIS frame and on the
previously set +FDIS parameter. A +FDT command from the DTE releases the DCE to
transmit that DCS frame.<p>
The DCE reports the initial received T.30 negotiation messages, including the
DIS frame and the optional CSI ID string. The +FDIS: report is followed by the
OK final result code.

The DCE can support a DTE command to answer an incoming call using the ATA
command (see Section 3.2). <p>
The DTE may issue an Answer command in response to an incoming ring.<p>
If the Answer command is unsuccessful, the DCE will report an appropriate
failure or error type result code, such as NO CARRIER (see Section 3.3).

string&gt;<br>OK<br>(DTE should issue +FDR command here)<p>
Upon receipt of an Answer command from the DTE, the DCE answers and generates
the CED tone. The DCE then generates a DIS frame (derived from the +FDIS
parameter) and hunts for the first T.30 negotiation frames. Upon detection of
the first Phase B preamble (V.21 ch 2 modulated by 300 bps HDLC flags), it
reports the "+FCON" message to the DTE.<p>
The DTE should report the initial received T.30 negotiation messages, including

Syntax:	+FDT &lt;CR&gt;<p>
The +FDT command prefixes Phase C data transmission. When the DCE is ready to
accept Phase C data, it issues the negotiation responses and the CONNECT result
code to the DTE.<p>
In Phase B, the +FDT command releases the DCE to proceed with negotiation, and
releases the DCS message to the remote station. In Phase C, the +FDT command
resumes transmission after the end of a prior transmit data stream.

Phase C data must be presented to the DCE in stream mode. The DCE expects Phase
C data to follow until it detects &lt;DLE&gt;&lt;ETX&gt; termination
characters. The DCE will filter the stream as described in Section 6.1.2. <p>
The DCE will acknowledge the end of the data by returning the OK result code to
the DTE.<p>
If there is data underrun before the next +FDT or +FET= command, the DCE will
zero-fill the pad as per T.4 until the Phase C timeout (+FPHCTO) is reached, or
until more data is received. The DCE appends an RTC pattern to the transmit
data after an +FET= command is received from the DTE.

The Phase C data will be of the format specified by the negotiated T.30 DCS
frame. The +FDCS:&lt;string&gt; response is defined in Section 6.4.2. The
subparameter values are described in Table 6-2.<p>
The DCE will use the negotiated minimum Scan Time parameter from the DCS frame,
and insert sufficient fill bits to pad each line to the minimum scan time. This
is reported in the +FDCS:ST subparameter.<p>
If the DCE finds more than one consecutive EOL in Phase C data (e.g., RTC), it
will send only one EOL.<p>
1.	Phase C data must conform to T.4 specifications.<p>
2.	The DTE need not include a final RTC, since the DCE will append an RTC in
response to an FET= command.<p>
3.	Some facsimile machines may treat two EOLs as an RTC.

The DCE may request the DTE to halt Phase C transmission, by sending a cancel
&lt;CAN&gt; character (024) to the DTE. In this case, the DTE should terminate
Phase C transmission, issue &lt;CAN&gt;, and wait for the OK response code from
the DCE.

The +FET=1 (EOM) command signals the remote station that the next document will
have a new DCS negotiated; this causes the session to re-enter Phase B.<p>

+FDR, Begin or Continue Phase C Receive Data</a> 
</i></b></p>
Syntax:	+FDR &lt;CR&gt;<p>
Default value:	3 seconds in some places<p>
The +FDR command initiates transition to Phase C data reception. This can occur
after answering, dialing, a document is received, or a page is received.<p>
The DCE reports the negotiated T.30 parameters, with the remote ID information
if available. When the DCE is ready to commence data transfer, it issues a
CONNECT response code. If the DCE cannot resume data transfer because there is
no more data, it responds OK. When the DTE is ready to accept data, it issues
an &lt;DC2&gt; character (018) to the DCE.<p>
If the DTE issues an &lt;XOFF&gt; character to the DCE for flow control, the
DCE signals the DTE when its buffers are empty by sending a
&lt;DLE&gt;&lt;DC2&gt; (&lt;016&gt;&lt;018&gt;) character pair. <p>
When the DCE delivers the last byte of a page, the DCE reports the Page
Transfer Status via the +FPTS:&lt;ppr&gt; response (Table 6-4).<p>
After a Page Transfer Status Report, the DCE reports the post page message from
the remote facsimile station via the +FET:&lt;ppm&gt; response (Table 6-3)
which signals the intentions of the remote station. <p>
The DCE holds the post page response message to the remote facsimile station
(MCF, etc.), represented in the +FPTS parameter until the next +FDR command.
The DTE may modify the +FPTS parameter before issuing the +FDR command which
releases that message. The DTE must issue a +FDR command to release Post Page
Messages.

Phase C data may be presented to the DTE in stream mode. The DCE will transfer
a stream of data to the DTE, followed by the &lt;DLE&gt;&lt;ETX&gt; stream
termination characters. The DCE will filter the stream as described in Section

From the +FDR command until the end of Phase D Date, the DCE is in a data
transfer state, and will not respond to DTE command characters. The DCE will
respond to three ASCII control characters: &lt;DC1&gt; (017) and &lt;DC3&gt;
(019) flow control characters, and cancel &lt;CAN&gt; (024).<p>
Upon receipt of the &lt;CAN&gt; character, the DCE will terminate the reporting
of received data by sending trailing &lt;DLE&gt;&lt;ETX&gt; characters to the
DTE, and will then execute an implied +FK command in order to conduct an
orderly disconnection.

The +FK command causes the DCE to terminate the session in an orderly manner.
In particular, the DCE will send a DCN message at the next opportunity and hang
up. At the end of the termination process, the DCE will report the +FHNG
response with result code (Table 6-5).<p>
This operation can be invoked by using the cancel &lt;CAN&gt; character during
Phase C data reception (see prior section)<p>

The DCE sends information responses to the DTE as a facsimile session proceeds.
They indicate the state of the facsimile session and convey needed information.
These messages are solicited messages generated in execution of DTE action
commands described in Section 6.3.<p>
The DCE precedes and follows the information responses with
&lt;CR&gt;&lt;LF&gt;.<p>
The DCE provides the on-line status of several session parameters when they are
available during T.30 handshaking. These include the remote ID string and the
DIS/DCS parameters. These responses report the T.30 session parameter frames.
The subparameters are described in Table 6-2.

two events occurred: 1) a DCN (disconnect) signal was received, or 2) an FCS
error was detected and the incoming signal was still present after 3 seconds.

SERVICE CLASS 2 PARAMETERS</a>
</b></p>
All Service Class 2 parameters can be read, written, and tested for range of
legal values by the DCE. The general syntax is described in Section 6.1.<p>
Group 3 FAX devices negotiate session parameters in DIS, DCS, and DTC frames.
The following parameters are provided to condition the facsimile DCE for the
capabilities it will offer and to report the session settings negotiated.<p>
The three primary T.30 session parameters are +FDCC, +FDIS and +FDCS. They are
compound parameters, using values listed in Table 6-2.<p>

+FDCC allows the DTE to sense and constrain the capabilities of the facsimile
DCE from the choices defined in CCITT T.30 Table 2. When +FDCC is modified by
the DTE, the DCE copies +FDCC into +FDIS.

The +FDIS parameter allows the DTE to sense and constrain the capabilities used
for the current session. The DCE uses +FDIS to generate DIS or DTC messages
directly, and uses +FDIS and received DIS messages to generate DCS messages.<p>
The DCE initializes the +FDIS parameter from the +FDCC parameter on
initialization, when +FDCC is written, and at the end of a session.

or	+FDCS=<p>
Valid values:	See Table 6-2<p>
Default values:	0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0<p>
The +FDCS parameter is loaded with the negotiated T.30 parameters for the
current session. A transmitting DCE generates DCS; a receiving DCE gets DCS
from the remote station. The DTE may read this parameter.<p>
The +FDCS parameter is initialized 0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0 upon initialization and at
the beginning of a session. If the DTE issues a +FDCS? command in the initial
state, the DCE reports:<p>
&lt;CR&gt;&lt;LF&gt;0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0&lt;CR&gt;&lt;LF&gt;<p>
The contents of +FDCS are spontaneously reported during execution of +FDR or
+FDT commands by the +FDCS:VR,BR,WD,LN,BF,EC,BF,ST response using the same
compound parameter format. <p>
Several commands and responses reference T.30 session negotiated parameters.
These are described by a set of common subparameters. These subparameters are
described in Table 6-2 with notes. Optional parameter values are marked with an
*. Unspecified parameter values are reserved for future use.<p>
The +FDCC, +FDIS, and +FDCS compound parameters use these session parameters
(On writes, unspecified subparameters are unchanged.)<p>
The +FDIS:, +FDCS:, and +FDTC: session report responses use these
subparameters.<p>
For test response, ranges of values are reported for each subparameter enclosed
in parentheses characters. For example, a DCE response to +FDCC=? could
report:<p>
&lt;CRLF&gt; (0,1), (0-5), (0-3), (0-2), (0-2), (0-2), (0), (0-7) &lt;CRLF&gt;

Default value:	0<p>
+FAA=0	Constrains the DCE to answer as set by +FCLASS.<p>
+FAA=1	Indicates that the DCE can answer and automatically determine whether to
answer as a Class 2 facsimile DCE or as a data modem. If the DCE automatically
switches, it modifies FCLASS appropriately.<p>
Class 2 adaptive answer is implemented as follows:<p>
First, a data mode handshake is attempted. If the DCE has been configured for
automode detection (using the +MS command), the DCE may try several protocols
before terminating attempts to make a data mode connection. This can take as
long as 6-8 seconds.<p>
If the data mode connection attempt fails, a facsimile Class 2 connection is
assumed. When a connection is made as a result of the adaptive answer, the DCE
issues the DATA or FAX result code before the CONNECT or +FCON message to
inform the DTE of the connection type. After making a Class 2 connection, the
DCE stays on-line rather than going into the command mode as with a Class 1
connection.

</p>
The modem is configured into Voice Mode (modem models not supporting business
audio) or Voice/Audio Mode (modem models supporting business audio) in response
to the AT #CLS=8 command, and this mode is composed of the Voice and Audio
sub-configurations as described in this section. Additional voice/audio AT
commands are available to support selection of operational parameters from both
inside and outside the Voice/Audio Mode.<p>
<b>a)</b>	<b>Voice Sub-Configuration</b>. Enhanced Adaptive Differential Pulse
Code Modulation (ADPCM) coding and decoding of analog voice is accomplished
with a 7.2 kHz sampling rate and 2 or 4 bits/sample quantization, and supports
efficient compression and decompression of digitized voice. Additionally, the
Voice Configuration supports concurrent tone generation/detection
capabilities.<p>
<b>b)</b>	<b>Audio Sub-Configuration (Available Only for Modem Models
Supporting Business Audio).</b> Linear PCM coding and decoding of analog audio
is accomplished with 7.2 kHz or 11.025 kHz sampling rates and 8 bits/sample
quantization, and supports superior sound quality as compared to ADPCM. With a
sampling rate of 7.2 kHz, the Audio Sub-configuration supports concurrent tone
generation/detection capabilities. With a sampling rate of 7.2 kHz or 11.025
kHz, this sub-configuration can be used to record and playback monophonic data
in 8-bit unsigned linear PCM format. <p>
<b>Note</b>:	The term "voice" is used to refer to both voice and audio
functions, except where otherwise noted.<p>
The Voice/Audio Mode (i.e., either sub-configuration) supports three submodes
once a voice connection has been established (refer to the descriptions of the
#CLS command): Online Voice Command Mode, Voice Receive Mode, and Voice
Transmit Mode. Determination of whether operation takes place in the Voice
sub-configuration or the Audio sub-configuration is made by use of the #VBS and
#VSR commands (refer to the descriptions of these commands).

Online Voice Command Mode</a></a> 
</a></i></b></p>
Online Voice Command Mode is the default Voice submode entered when the #CLS=8
command is issued, and may also be entered from Voice Receive Mode or Voice
Transmit Mode. Entry into Online Voice Command Mode is indicated to the DTE via
the VCON message, after which AT commands can be entered without aborting the
telephone line connection.<p>
If the modem is the answerer, it enters Online Voice Command Mode immediately
after going off-hook, and can report instances of DTMF tones and calling tones
to the DTE. If the modem is the originator, it enters Online Voice Command Mode
based on detection of the ringback cadence going away, upon expiration of the
ringback never came timer, or upon detection of answer tone, and the modem can
report DTMF tones, answer tones, busy tone, and dial tone to the DTE. (Note
that DTMF tone reporting is supported in this mode if DTMF reporting is enabled
via the #VTD command.)<p>
When this mode is entered as a result of going off-hook with the D or A
command, VCON is always sent to the DTE, after which the modem accepts
commands. If this mode is entered from Voice Transmit Mode, the DTE has issued
the &lt;DLE&gt;&lt;ETX&gt;, and the modem responds with VCON. If this mode is
entered from the Voice Receive Mode because of a key abort, the modem issues
the &lt;DLE&gt;&lt;ETX&gt; followed by VCON.<p>
If the #VLS command has switched in a handset or other device in place of the
telephone line, Online Voice Command Mode is immediately entered, whereas if
the telephone line is selected, a physical connection with another station must
occur before entering this mode.

<p class="bodytext"><b><i>
<a name="RTFToC323">7.1.2
Voice Receive Mode</a>
</i></b></p>
Voice Receive Mode is entered when the DTE issues the #VRX command in order to
receive voice data. This typically occurs when either recording a greeting
message, or when recording voice messages from a remote station.<p>
In Voice Receive Mode, voice samples from the modem analog-to-digital converter
(ADC) are sent either to the ADPCM codec for compression, or to the PCM coder
for linear PCM coding, and can then be read by the host. AT commands control
the voice sampling rate as well as codec bits-per-sample rates, and can also be
used to select adjustment of the silence detection period and sensitivity level
when ADPCM compression is selected.<p>
In this mode, and when the sampling rate is 7.2 kHz, the modem detects and
reports DTMF, dial tone, and busy tone cadence as enabled by the #VTD command.
Additionally, the modem detects and reports inactivity (periods of silence) as
enabled by the #VSS command. The modem can exit the Voice Receive Mode only via
a DTE Key Abort, or via Disconnect Inactivity timer (S30) expiration.

<p class="bodytext"><b><i>
<a name="RTFToC324">7.1.3
Voice Transmit Mode</a>
</i></b></p>
Voice Transmit Mode is entered when the DTE issues the #VTX command in order to
transmit voice data. In this mode, when the sampling rate is 7.2 kHz, the modem
continues to detect and report DTMF and calling tones if enabled by the #VTD
command. This mode is typically used when playing back greeting messages or
previously received/recorded messages.<p>
In this mode:<p>
1.	If the Voice Sub-configuration is in operation, voice decompression is
provided by the ADPCM codec, and the decompressed ADPCM voice data is then
reconstituted into analog voice by the DAC at the original compression
quantization sample-per-bits rate.<p>
2.	If the Audio Sub-configuration is in operation, PCM decoding is provided by
the linear PCM decoder, and the decoded audio data is then reconstituted into
analog voice by the DAC at the original 1 sample/8 bits rate.

<a name="RTFToC327">Directed
Originate (Dial as a specific modem type)</a></a>
</a></i></p>
For most call originations, it is known ahead of time what type of call is
being attempted, and it is acceptable to disconnect if the remote side of the
connection does not cooperate. In this case, the modem can be configured ahead
of time with the existing +FCLASS (and +FAE=0 or +FAA=0) or the #CLS command to
be a data, fax, or voice/audio modem. For Data and Fax Modes, the modem
subsequently either succeeds with the desired type of connection, or eventually
hangs up. For the Voice/Audio Mode, the DTE has the option of hanging up if
there are indications that the remote station has not answered in voice, thus
implementing a directed originate for voice. The following are the three
connection type choices:
<h5>
<a name="RTFToC328">Voice/Audio</a></h5>
The modem dials and reports call progress to the DTE, which reduces to
reporting "NO DIALTONE", "BUSY", or "NO ANSWER".<p>
The modem allows the DTE to program a time period, which if elapsed after any
ringback is detected, forces the modem to assume the remote has gone off-hook.
A secondary time period (safety valve) can define a maximum elapsed time after
dialing for receiving no ringback before the modem assumes that the remote has
gone off-hook. This safety valve is devised in case the remote picks up the
telephone before any ringback is generated, and no other tones are detected. In
this mode, the modem is attempting to make a voice connection only and
therefore, while waiting for ringback to disappear, it is also feasible to
disconnect upon detection something which is definitely not voice from the
remote, such as any answer tone. The modem provides detection of "ringback went
away or never came".
<h5>
<a name="RTFToC329">Fax</a></h5>
The modem dials and reports call progress to the DTE as in all modes. A Fax
Class 1 or Fax Class 2 handshake is pursued according to the current
configuration.
<h5>
<a name="RTFToC330">Data</a></h5>
The modem dials and reports call progress to the DTE as in all modes. A data
handshake is pursued according to the current configuration.

<p class="bodytext"><i>
<a name="RTFToC331">Adaptive
Originate (Dial with Voice/Data/Fax Discrimination)</a>
</i></p>
The DTE may wish to originate a call which adapts to the remote answerer. For
instance, the user may wish to send a voice message if a human picks up the
telephone, but a facsimile if a fax machine answers. The modem can facilitate
this type of adaptive originate by extending what it does for the directed
originate modes. After determining that the remote station has picked up the
line, the modem goes back to Online Voice Command Mode, thus terminating the
"connecting state." Once in this mode, the modem reports what it receives from
the answerer via specific result codes to the DTE. The DTE can then have the
option of pursuing a data, fax, or voice/audio connection.

<p class="bodytext"><i>
<a name="RTFToC333">Directed
Answer (Answer as a specific modem type)</a></a>
</a></i></p>
If the DTE wants to be only one kind of answerer (i.e., voice/audio, fax, or
data), it can configure the modem to answer exclusively in the chosen mode.
<h5>
<a name="RTFToC334">Voice/Audio</a></h5>
The modem is configured to answer in Voice/Audio Mode only and assumes the
caller will cooperate. After going off-hook, the voice VCON is issued, no
answer tone is generated, and the modem is immediately placed in Online Voice
Command Mode. The DTE typically responds by sending a greeting message of some
type, and DTMF tone recognition/reporting can be enabled. Eventually, an
incoming voice message can be recorded by the host. (Unpredictable results
occur if the caller is not prepared for a voice call.)
<h5>
<a name="RTFToC335">Fax</a></h5>
The modem is configured to answer in Fax Class 1 or Fax Class 2 Mode only, and
it assumes the caller is going to cooperate. This configuration has the effect
of disabling Voice/Audio Mode, forcing +FCLASS to either 1 or 2, and forcing
both +FAA and +FAE to 0. 
<h5>
<a name="RTFToC336">Data</a></h5>
The modem is configured to answer in Data Mode only and assumes the caller is
going to cooperate. This configuration has the effect of disabling Voice/Audio
Mode, forcing +FCLASS = 0, and forcing both +FAA and +FAE to 0.

<p class="bodytext"><i>
<a name="RTFToC337">Adaptive
Answer (Answer with Voice/Data/Fax Discrimination)</a>
</i></p>
In normal operation, it is desirable for a modem supporting fax and voice to
provide the ability to discriminate between the two when answering unsolicited
or unattended calls. (It is most often the case that a fax is received or a
voice message recorded when nobody is present.) 
<h5>
<a name="RTFToC338">Data/Fax
Discrimination
</a></h5>
If the DTE wishes to allow for a data or fax call, the +FCLASS and +FAA or +FAE
commands can be configured for adaptive answer between data and Class 1 or
Class 2 fax.
<h5>
<a name="RTFToC339">Voice/Fax
Discrimination
</a></h5>
This is the most important discrimination capability needed from the user's
standpoint. The modem must be configured for Voice/Audio (#CLS=8), causing the
modem to enter Online Voice Command Mode immediately upon going off-hook. In
Voice/Audio Mode, the DTE automatically receives indications of DTMF tones and
Calling Tones. The DTE can now switch to Voice Transmit Mode in order to play a
greeting message, perhaps one which instructs the caller how to enter specific
DTMF sequences to switch modes. The DTE can then react to the response, or the
lack thereof, to such a message. The modem supports switching to Class 1 or
Class 2 answer mode by virtue of the #CLS=1 or #CLS=2 command, and if such a
switch is made and fails, the modem reports the failure but does not hang up,
allowing the DTE further experimentation time. If the user wishes to switch to
Class 1 or Class 2, but also wants the DTE to indeed hang up the line if the
fax fails, the +FCLASS command should be used instead of the #CLS command. The
only difference between these commands is that issuing +FCLASS cancels the
modem's memory of voice, whereas #CLS causes the modem to remain off-hook, even
if a fax or data handshake fails, until it receives an H command.
<h5>
<a name="RTFToC340">Voice/Data/Fax
Discrimination
</a></h5>
The DTE can try data modem operation after an answer by changing the #CLS
setting to 0. A data handshake attempt can be added based upon DTMF responses
or lack thereof.

<a name="RTFToC341">7.2.3
Voice/Audio Data Transfer</a>
</i></b></p>
A significant area of concern when handling the transfer of voice/audio data is
the data transfer rate on the modem/DTE interface. Data transfer rates can be
expressed as the number of interrupts which must be serviced per time period to
keep up. This is a function of the sampling rate and compression method (if
any) used by the modem, and the DTE interface speed required to handle the data
flow on the telephone line side.<p>
Tables 7-1a and 7-1b demonstrate the relationship between the sampling rate,
interrupt rate, and DTE speed necessary for the modem to support various
compression ratios. The built-in 16C550A UART-compatible interface in the MCU
hardware is required to support Voice/Audio Mode operation in the Microsoft
Windows environment.

Tone and Status Monitoring  Shielded &lt;DLE&gt; Statuses</a>
</i></b></p>
The modem can detect specific tones and other status information, and report
these to the DTE while in any of the three voice submodes. The modem
simultaneously looks for 1300 and 1100 Hz calling tones when answering, and for
CCITT and Bell answer tones when originating. The modem can also detect dial or
busy tones in any of the three voice submodes. All detected tones, as well as
certain other statuses addressed in Table 7-2 such as silence and "telset
off-hook" (i.e., handset off-hook) are reported as shielded codes.<p>
When in Online Voice Command Mode or Voice Transmit Mode, the codes in Table
7-2 are sent to the DTE immediately upon verification by the modem of the
associated tone, status, or cadence. In this mode, the 2-character code is not
buffered, nor does the DTE have the ability to stop the code with flow control.
If the DTE has started (but not completed) sending any AT command, the Tone
Monitoring function is disabled until the command has been received and
processed.<p>
The modem can discriminate between single and multiple DTMF tones received. If
calling tone, dial tone, busy tone, or answer tone is detected, this detection
is reported repeatedly (at reasonable intervals) if the DTE takes no action,
and the tone continues to be detected.

                Tone (Data or Fax) is detected. If the DTE fails to react to the code, and   
                the modem continues to detect Answer tone, the code is repeated as often     
                as once every half second.

                &lt;DLE&gt;b code every 4 seconds if busy continues to be detected and the DTE     
                does not react. This allows the DTE the flexibility of ignoring what could

                If the DTE fails to react to the code and the modem continues to detect      
                Answer tone, the code is repeated as often as every 1/2 second.              
    &lt;DLE&gt;h      Hung Up Handset. Sent immediately when the modem detects that the local      
                handset has hung-up (i.e., has transitioned from off-hook to on-hook)        
                while in any of the three voice submodes.                                    
    &lt;DLE&gt;o      Overrun. Sent in Voice Receive Mode if the voice receive data buffer         
                overflows, in which case, the latest data is lost in favor of retaining      
                the oldest data in the buffer. (The DTE may not have been reading data       
                from the modem lately.) The modem inserts the &lt;DLE&gt;o at the end of the       
                buffer, thus marking the location where data was lost by the DTE. The        
                modem does not append &lt;DLE&gt;o codes to the buffer contiguously. If more       
                than one data byte is lost before the DTE begins reading again, there is     
                only on &lt;DLE&gt;o code in the data stream. However, if the DTE resumes          
                reading, and then once again allows the buffer to overflow, a new &lt;DLE&gt;o     
                is appended to the data by the modem. Thus, the &lt;DLE&gt;o does not indicate     
                how many bytes of contiguous data has been lost, but may report multiple     
                gaps of lost data in the data stream.                                        
    &lt;DLE&gt;q      Quiet. Sent in Voice Receive Mode following any remaining data in the        
                receive voice buffer when the silence detection timer (#VSP) expires and     
                there has been voice data passed to the DTE. Note that with #VSS=0, the      
                Quiet message never occurs. In general, &lt;DLE&gt;q is sent if first there was    
                sound, and now there is no sound, and means that somebody has stopped        
                talking, and according to the criteria selected in the #VSP and #VSS         
                settings, is probably not going to start again. If the DTE ignores the       
                &lt;DLE&gt;q code, the modem automatically resets its timer and sends the code     
                again if the #VSP time period again expires. This allows the DTE time to     
                react to what may be a false silence detection.                              

    &lt;DLE&gt;s      Silence. Sent in Voice Receive Mode after the silence detection timer        
                (#VSP) expires and if valid voice has not been detected (#VSS). In           
                general, &lt;DLE&gt;s is sent if no sound was detected at all. This differs        
                slightly from Quiet (&lt;DLE&gt;q) in that it can be used by the DTE in its        
                discrimination algorithms as a means of determining if anything at all is    
                coming from the remote station. If the DTE ignores the &lt;DLE&gt;s code, the      
                modem automatically resets its timer and sends the code again if the #VSP    
                time period again expires. This allows the DTE time to react to what may     
                be a false detection of silence.                                             
    &lt;DLE&gt;t      Handset Off-Hook. Sent one time when the local handset transition from       
                on-hook to off-hook is detected in any of the three voice submodes.          
    &lt;DLE&gt;u      Underrun. Sent in Voice Transmit Mode when the voice transmit buffer         
                becomes empty without receiving a &lt;DLE&gt;&lt;ETX&gt; or &lt;DLE&gt;&lt;CAN&gt; command first.    
                The modem remains in transmit mode, but issues the &lt;DLE&gt;u to indicate that   
                silence is being generated. When the DTE resumes sending bytes, the modem    
                allows a small number of bytes to build up in the buffer before              
                re-enabling the transmitter to avoid repeated underruns. However, with the   
                underrun condition, the modem does not wait for the XOFF threshold (or       
                timer) to be met before resuming, as it does on an initial transmit or       
                resume operation because the remote listener may be unaware of the           
                underrun, and keeping the silence short may serve to mask the underrun       
                altogether.                                                                  
    &lt;DLE&gt;T      Timing Mark. Sent in Voice Receive Mode, and placed in the data stream at    
                1 second intervals, when enabled by #VTM = 10.                               
  &lt;DLE&gt;&lt;ETX&gt;    End of Stream. &lt;DLE&gt;&lt;ETX&gt; is sent to denote the end of a voice data          
                stream, similar to fax Class 1 and 2. This occurs in Voice Receive Mode      
                only after the DTE issues the key abort.

Shielded &lt;DLE&gt; Commands from the DTE</a></a>
</a></i></b></p>
Most commands issued for voice are implemented as extensions to the AT command
set, and are accepted only if the modem is in a valid command mode, such as
Online Voice Command Mode. However, there are some operations which are
available to the DTE without necessitating a switch to Online Voice Command
Mode. The most obvious of these is the &lt;DLE&gt;&lt;ETX&gt; which the DTE
issues during Voice Transmit Mode to terminate an output message. Table 7-3
lists shielded &lt;DLE&gt; commands recognized by the modem.

 Code Sent to   Meaning                                                                      
    Modem                                                                                    
&lt;DLE&gt;p          Pause. Sent during Voice Transmit Mode to force the modem to suspend         
                sending voice data to the selected output device(s). Any data currently in   
                the voice transmit buffer is saved until either a resume (&lt;DLE&gt;r), or        
                cancel &lt;DLE&gt;&lt;CAN&gt;, is received, in which case the data is lost. If a         
                &lt;DLE&gt;&lt;ETX&gt; is received during the paused state, the modem processes it       
                normally, and also automatically resumes transmission of the data left in    
                the buffer (appended with &lt;DLE&gt;&lt;ETX&gt;). Any other data received from the      
                DTE while in this paused state is placed in the transmit buffer according    
                to available space, with flow control active. (This command is ignored in    
                other voice submodes.)                                                       
&lt;DLE&gt;r          Resume. Sent during Voice Transmit Mode to force the modem to resume         
                sending voice data to the selected output device(s). Any data currently in   
                the voice transmit buffer is now played. (This command is ignored in other   
                voice modes.) The pause and resume commands are different than a simple      
                suspension of data; data in the buffer is "frozen" and not played when the   
                DTE pauses.                                                                  
&lt;DLE&gt;E          Purge DCE Buffer. Sent during the transmission or reception of voice/audio   
                data, by embedding the command in the voice data stream, to purge the        
                corresponding DCE buffer. (See the &lt;DLE&gt;&lt;EOT&gt; code.)                         
&lt;DLE&gt;u          Increment Playback Volume. Sent during audio mode to increment the           
                playback volume. The &lt;DLE&gt;u action command allows the application to         
                increase the playback volume of the headphone and speaker outputs during     
                playback while in the data state. Each &lt;DLE&gt;u will increment the transmit    
                level by 1 unit. Adjustment by a value greater than 1 may be achieved by     
                transmitting a string of &lt;DLE&gt;u codes. For example, a string consisting of   
                "&lt;DLE&gt;u &lt;DLE&gt;u &lt;DLE&gt;u &lt;DLE&gt;u &lt;DLE&gt;u" increases the playback volume by a      
                value of 5 units. The &lt;DLE&gt;u code can be used to adjust the volume within    
                the range of 128-228. (See &lt;DLE&gt;&lt;u&gt; and &lt;DLE&gt;&lt;d&gt; in Section 7.3.2.)          
&lt;DLE&gt;d          Decrement Playback Volume. Sent during audio mode to decrement the           
                playback volume. The &lt;DLE&gt;d action command allows the application to         
                decrease the playback volume of the headphone and speaker outputs during     
                playback while in the data state. Each &lt;DLE&gt;d will decrement the transmit    
                level by 1 unit. Adjustment by a value greater than 1 may be achieved by     
                transmitting a string of &lt;DLE&gt;d codes. For example, a string consisting of   
                "&lt;DLE&gt;d &lt;DLE&gt;d &lt;DLE&gt;d &lt;DLE&gt;d &lt;DLE&gt;d" decreases the playback volume by a      
                value of 5 units. The &lt;DLE&gt;d code can be used to adjust the volume within    
                the range of 128-228. (See &lt;DLE&gt;&lt;u&gt; and &lt;DLE&gt;&lt;d&gt; in Section 7.3.2.)          
&lt;DLE&gt;&lt;CAN&gt;      Cancel. Sent during Voice Transmit Mode to indicate that the DTE has         
                finished transmitting a voice message and wants the modem to discard any     
                remaining data in the voice transmit buffer. The modem immediately purges    
                its buffer, and then responds with the VCON message entering Online Voice    
                Command Mode. (This command is ignored by the modem when not in Voice        
                Transmit Mode.)                                                              
&lt;DLE&gt;&lt;EOT&gt;      Voice Bytes Buffered Query. Sent during the transmission or reception of     
                voice/audio data, by embedding the command in the voice data stream, to      
                learn the number of corresponding bytes buffered by the DCE at the moment    
                the &lt;DLE&gt;&lt;EOT&gt; command is received by the DCE. &lt;DLE&gt;XZBBC=n&lt;DLE&gt; is          
                returned by the DCE, in which "n" represents the number of bytes buffered    
                as a two byte hexadecimal value.                                             
&lt;DLE&gt;&lt;ETX&gt;      Terminate. Sent during Voice Transmit Mode to indicate that the DTE has      
                finished transmitting a voice message. The modem completes transmission of   
                any remaining data in the voice transmit buffer before responding with the   
                VCON message and entering Online Voice Command Mode. (This command is        
                ignored by the modem when not in Voice Transmit Mode.)

Voice Record</a>
</i></b></p>
To effect recording of a message received via a handset or microphone, the DTE
must configure the modem for Voice Mode (#CLS=8), and select the proper relay
setup (#VLS) to instruct the modem whether to use the auxiliary device. The
modem responds to the #VLS command by issuing a relay activate command to
select the input device. When a device other than the telephone line is
selected, the modem immediately enters Online Voice Command Mode (indicated by
VCON). DTMF detection is therefore enabled as soon as the DTE selects the
device, such as a handset, although the user still needs to physically pick up
the telephone and "press buttons." Even if the DTE has not entered Voice
Receive or Transmit Modes (#VTX or #VRX), these DTMF tones are delivered via
shielded codes identically to when a physical telephone connection exists but
the DTE has not yet commanded receive or transmit.<p>
When the DTE decides to record the message, it issues the #VRX command and upon
command receipt, the modem immediately switches to Voice Receive Mode. Since
the microphone or handset is switched in, the modem immediately issues the
CONNECT message indicating that the modem has switched to Voice Receive Mode
and is beginning the transfer of ADPCM voice or PCM audio data as well as
shielded DTMF tones, and other tones and statuses.<p>
In this recording state, the modem (if so configured) monitors for line
silence. If the #VSP period expires, the modem sends the &lt;DLE&gt;q or
&lt;DLE&gt;s code to the DTE.<p>
Recording can be canceled only via two events:<p>
1.	The DTE sends any character to the modem. This is the key abort, and is the
normal method of terminating the receive mode.<p>
2.	The S30 Disconnect Inactivity timer expires, which is generally an undesired
event.

<a name="RTFToC345">7.2.7
Voice Playback</a>
</i></b></p>
To effect playback of a message recorded via a handset or microphone, or of a
message recorded during a voice call, the DTE must configure the modem for
Voice Mode (#CLS=8) and select the proper relay setup (#VLS) to instruct the
modem whether to use the handset or speaker. The modem responds to the #VLS
command by issuing a relay activate command to select the input device. The
hardware must provide a means of selecting a handset and/or microphone instead
of the telephone line, as this input device. When a device other that the
telephone line is selected, the modem immediately enters Online Voice Command
Mode (indicated by VCON). DTMF detection is thus enabled as soon as the DTE
selects the device, such as a handset, although the user still needs to
physically pick up the telephone before he can issue DTMF tones. Once selected,
however, the user can indeed pick up the telephone and "press buttons." Even if
the DTE has not entered Voice Receive or Transmit Modes (#VTX or #VRX), these
DTMF tones are delivered via shielded codes, identically to when a physical
telephone connection exists but the DTE has not yet commanded receive nor
transmit.<p>
When the DTE decides to play the message, it issues the #VTX command, and the
modem immediately switches to Voice Transmit Mode. Since the speaker or handset
is already switched in, the modem immediately issues the CONNECT message
indicating that the modem is in Voice Transmit Mode and is expecting voice data
from the DTE.<p>
A subsequent &lt;DLE&gt;&lt;ETX&gt; has to be issued to switch back to Online
Voice Command Mode.

which cause some change in the current operating behavior of the modem) are
identified as such, and the remaining commands are parameters.<p>
All voice commands that can have a value of 0-255 will not respond error if a
value above 255 is entered; the resulting value will be the value entered minus
256 or 512, etc.

<a name="RTFToC359">ATA
- Answering in Voice/Audio</a>
</i></p>
The answer action command works analogously to the way it works in Data and Fax
Modes except for the following: <p>
1.	When configured for Voice/Audio Mode (#CLS=8), the modem enters Online Voice
Command Mode immediately after going off-hook. When the #CLS=8 command is
issued, the modem can be programmed to look for 1100 and 1300 Hz calling tones
(see #VTD), thus eliminating the need to do so as part of A command processing.
After the VCON message is issued, the modem re-enters Online Voice Command Mode
while sending any incoming DTMF or Calling Tone indications to the DTE as
described in Section 7.2.5.<p>
2.	After answering in Voice/Audio Mode (#CLS=8), the DTE, as part of its call
discrimination processing, can decide to change the #CLS setting to attempt
receiving a fax in Class 1, or to make a data connection. In such a case, the
DTE commands the modem to proceed with the data or fax handshake via the A
command even though the modem is already off-hook.<p>
Result Code:<p>
VCON	Issued in Voice Mode (#CLS=8) immediately after going off-hook.

<p class="bodytext"><i>
<a name="RTFToC360">ATD
- Dial Command in Voice/Audio</a>
</i></p>
The dial action command works analogously to the way it works in Data or Fax
modes. When in Voice/Audio Mode (#CLS=8):<p>
1.	The modem attempts to determine when the remote has picked up the telephone
line and once this determination has been made, the VCON message is sent to the
DTE. This determination is initially made based upon ringback detection and
disappearance. (See #VRA and #VRN commands.)<p>
2.	Once connected in Voice/Audio Mode, the modem immediately enters the command
state and switches to Online Voice Command Mode which enables unsolicited
reporting of DTMF and answer tones to the DTE. <p>
Parameters:	Same as Data and Fax modes.<p>
Result Codes:<p>
VCON	Issued in Voice/Audio Mode (#CLS=8) when the modem determines that the
remote modem or handset has gone off-hook, or when returning to the Online
Voice Command Mode. (See #VRA and #VRN.)<p>
NO ANSWER	Issued in Voice/Audio Mode (#CLS=8) when the modem determines that
the remote has not picked up the line before the S7 timer expires. Though the
modem reports "NO ANSWER", the DTE has the responsibility of issuing an ATH (or
ATZ) to disconnect the telephone line while #CLS=8.

<p class="bodytext"><i>
<a name="RTFToC361">ATH
- Hang Up in Voice/Audio</a>
</i></p>
This command works the same as in Data and Fax modes by hanging up
(disconnecting) the telephone line. There are, however, some specific
considerations when in Voice/Audio Mode:<p>
1.	The H command forces #CLS=0, but does not destroy any of the voice parameter
settings such as #VBS, #VSP, etc. Therefore, if the DTE wishes to issue an H
command and then pursue another voice call, it must issue a subsequent #CLS=8
command, but it need not re-establish the voice parameter settings again unless
a change in the settings is desired.<p>
2.	The #BDR setting is forced back to 0, re-enabling autobaud.<p>
3.	If the #VLS setting is set to select a device which is not, or does not
include the telephone line (such as a local handset or microphone), the H
command deselects this device and reselects the normal default setting (#VLS
=0). Normally, the DTE should not issue the H command while connected to a
local device such as a handset, because merely selecting this device results in
VCON. The normal sequence of terminating a session with such a device is to use
the #VLS command to select the telephone line, which by definition makes sure
it is on-hook. <p>
Parameters:	Same as Data and Fax modes.<p>
Result Codes:	Same as Data and Fax modes.

<a name="RTFToC362">ATZ
- Reset from Voice Mode</a>
</i></p>
This command works the same as in Data and Fax modes. In addition, the Z
command resets all voice related parameters to default states, forces the
#BDR=0 condition (autobaud enabled), and forces the telephone line to be
selected with the handset on-hook. No voice parameters are stored in NVRAM so
the profile loaded does not affect the voice aspects of this command. (Note
that when #CLS=8, ATZ causes a hang up if the telephone line is connected.)<p>

<p class="bodytext"><i>
<a name="RTFToC363">#BDR
- Select Baud Rate (Turn off Autobaud)</a>
</i></p>
This command forces the modem to select a specific DTE/modem baud rate without
further speed sensing on the interface. When a valid #BDR=n command is entered,
the OK result code is sent at the current assumed speed. After the OK has been
sent, the modem switches to the speed indicated by the #BDR=n command it has
just received.<p>
When in Online Voice Command Mode and the #BDR setting is nonzero (no autobaud
selected), the modem supports a full duplex DTE interface. This means that the
DTE can enter commands at any time, even if the modem is in the process of
sending a shielded code indicating DTMF detection to the DTE. [Note that when
#BDR has been set nonzero, the modem employs the S30 Disconnect Inactivity
timer, and this timer starts at the point where #BDR is set nonzero. If this
period expires (nominally 60 seconds) with no activity on the DTE interface,
the modem reverts to #BDR=0, #CLS=0, and #VLS=0.] <p>
Parameters:	n = 0 - 48 (New baud rate is n*2400 bps)<p>
Default:	0<p>
Result Codes:<p>
OK	For the supported speeds.<p>
ERROR	Otherwise.<p>
Command options:<p>
#BDR?	Returns the current setting of the #BDR command as an ASCII decimal value
in result code format.<p>
#BDR=?	Returns a message indicating the speeds that are supported.<p>
#BDR=0	Enables autobaud detection on the DTE interface. <p>
#BDR=n	Where 1&lt;n&lt;48. Sends OK message at current speed, then switches to
the new speed defined by n*2400 bps unless and until another #BDR=n command is
received. Autobaud is disabled, and the character format is maintained at the
format most recently detected.

	When a disconnect or inactivity time out in the non-autobaud mode is detected,
the modem automatically sets the #CLS setting to 0 and hangs up. This ensures
that the modem is always in a known state despite disorderly DTE behavior.<p>
#CLS=1	Class 1 fax. This is similar to setting +FCLASS=1, and instructs the
modem to be a Class 1 fax modem. Once this is set, either the +FAA or the +FAE

Command options:<p>
#VLS?	This query returns the current setting of the #VLS command as an ASCII

#VLS=?	This query requests a report of the device types available for
selection. The response is a number from 0 to 4 corresponding the device
position number (see Table 7-5).<p>
#VLS=0	The default option on the modem. This command instructs the modem that
when entering any of the three voice operating submodes (Online Command,
Transmit, or Receive), that the telephone line interface should be routed
through the modem. The OK response is sent to the DTE, and any previous
connection is lost (i.e., the modem ends up on-hook as a result of issuing this
command to connect to the telephone line).<p>
#VLS=1	This command instructs the modem to route only the handset through the

immediately switches to Online Voice Command Mode, and the VCON response is
generated for completeness. However, since this is an output only device,
nothing of consequence can happen until the DTE sends the #VTX command.<p>
#VLS=3	This command instructs the modem that only the auxiliary input device
(microphone) should be routed through the modem. This setting can be chosen
before recording a greeting message.<p>
#VLS=4	This command is the same as #VLS =0, except that the modem enables the
internal speaker as well as the telephone line/handset circuit. <p>
#VLS=5	This command selects telephone emulation mode while in #CLS=8 mode.
Speakerphone operation is entered during Voice On-line (VCON) mode after
completing dialing (ATD) or answering (ATA). #VLS=5 will respond ERROR if
speakerphone is supported. <p>
#VLS=6	This command selects speakerphone mode while in #CLS=8 mode. Telephone
emulation operation is entered during Voice On-line (VCON) mode after
completing dialing (ATD) or answering (ATA). #VLS=6 will respond ERROR if
speakerphone is not supported. <p>
#VLS=7	This command, valid after Voice On-line mode, mutes the local handset by
switching the handset or speakerphone out of the telephone line path if in
#VLS=0 or #VLS=6 mode. To unmute, the host software should issue AT#VLS=0 or
AT#VLS=6 to return to phone line or speakerphone mode, respectively. On
hardware designs which incorporate the audio codec, #VLS=7 can be used to route
the codec's output through the phone line to provide music-on-hold feature.<p>
#VLS=8	(Valid after Voice On-line mode.) This command engages the Caller ID
relay to allow recording of conversation when using a handset by routing the
signal to the audio codec (if populated). To deactivate the Caller ID relay,
the host should issue an AT#VLS=0 or AT#VLS=6 to return to phone line or
speakerphone mode, respectively.<p>
#VLS=9	This command routes the handset to the sound codec to allow
recording/playback of audio (e.g. greeting messages) through the local handset.

     0        Telephone Line with Telephone handset. This is the default device selected.     
              In this configuration, the user can pick up a handset which is connected to     
              the same telephone line as the modem, and * record both sides of a              
              conversation with a remote station. The modem currently supports one            
              telephone line/handset, which is in the first position of the #VLS =?           
              response. (Note that the modem can interface to multiple telephone lines by     
              having "0"'s in multiple positions in the #VLS ? response.) If a telephone      
              line is selected, the modem must be on-hook or it hangs up. The OK message is   
              generated.                                                                      
     1        Transmit/Receive Device (other than telephone line). This is a handset,         
              headset, or speaker-phone powered directly by the modem. When such a device     
              is selected, the modem immediately enters Online Voice Command Mode, DTMF       
              monitoring is enabled if applicable, and the VCON response is sent. The modem   
              supports one such device as the second device listed in the #VLS =? response.   
     2        Transmit Only Device. Normally, this is the onboard speaker. When this device   
              is selected, the modem immediately enters Online Voice Command Mode, and the    
              VCON response is sent. The modem supports selection of the internal speaker     
              as the third device listed in #VLS =? response.                                 
     3        Receive Only Device. Normally, this is a microphone. When such a device is      
              selected, the modem immediately enters Online Voice Command Mode, DTMF          
              monitoring is enabled if applicable, and the VCON response is sent. The modem   
              supports one microphone as the fourth element returned in the #VLS =?

              allow the DTE to select the telephone line/handset (if picked up) with the      
              modem speaker also turned ON. This can be used by the DTE to allow the user     
              to monitor an incoming message as it is recorded.                               
     5        Telephone Emulation. This is a headset or speakerphone powered directly by      
              the modem. When such a device is selected, the modem immediately enters         
              Online Voice Command Mode, DTMF monitoring is enabled if applicable, and the    
              VCON response is sent.                                                          
     6        Speakerphone. This is a headset or speakerphone powered directly by the         
              modem. When such a device is selected, the modem immediately enters Online      
              Voice Command Mode, DTMF monitoring is enabled if applicable, and the VCON      
              response is sent.                                                               
     7        Muting the Local Handset During Phone Conversation - Music on Hold. This

              of the telephone line path if in #VLS=0 or #VLS=6 mode. To unmute, the host     
              software should issue AT#VLS=0 or AT#VLS=6 to return to phone line or           
              speakerphone mode, respectively.  On hardware designs which incorporate the     
              audio codec, #VLS=7 can be used to route the codec's output through the phone   
              line to provide music-on-hold feature.                                          
     8        Recording a Handset Conversation on Phone Line. This command engages the

not detected within this period, the modem assumes that the remote has picked
up the line and switches to Online Voice Command Mode. Every time a ringback
cycle is detected, this timer is reset. <p>
Parameters:	n = 0 - 255 (0 - 2.55 seconds)<p>
Default:	70<p>
Result Code:	OK<p>
Result Code:<p>
OK	If n = 0 - 255.<p>

This command sets the Voice Receive Mode silence detection period (inactivity
timer) value. The parameter, in units of 100 ms, can be used when receiving
voice data. This is an amount of time, which if elapsed without receiving any
ADPCM data, causes the modem to send the &lt;DLE&gt;s or &lt;DLE&gt;q codes
after insuring that the buffer is empty.<p>
The modem determines what constitutes silence. This involves monitoring and
debouncing the modem value for average energy. If this debounced value is less
than an arbitrary threshold constituting the modem's definition of silence for
a period greater than that defined by the #VSP setting, the modem sends the
&lt;DLE&gt;q or &lt;DLE&gt;s shielded code to the DTE.<p>

</i></p>
Switching between different #VLS settings during Voice On-line mod is permitted
although only certain combinations may be useful. The #VLS settings are grouped
into local and remote.  Switching between #VLS settings should be within either
local or remote groups.<p>
Local #VLS settings are defined as the modem being on-hook and isolated from
the telco line<p>
during Voice On-line (VCON) mode.  The local settings are #VLS=1, #VLS=2,
#VLS=3, and #VLS=9.  Remote #VLS settings are defined as the modem being
off-hook and connected to the telco line during Voice On-line mode.  The remote
settings are #VLS=0, #VLS=4, #VLS=5, #VLS=6. #VLS=7, and #VLS=8.
<h5>
<a name="RTFToC399">Example
1
</a></h5>
An example of how host software will switch #VLS settings in local mode is an
application which records a greeting message through the handset and review the
message through the speaker.  To accomplish this functionality, the modem is
set to #VLS=1 (local handset recording/playback) during the recording process
and is switched to #VLS=2 (playback through speaker) to monitor the playback.
<h5>
<a name="RTFToC400">Example
2 
</a></h5>
An example of how host software will switch #VLS settings in remote mode is a
telephone answering application which has a call screening mode.  The
application plays a greeting message with the speaker off (#VLS=0) and switches
the speaker on when recording the incoming message (#VLS=4).  If the user
decides to answer the call he picks up the handset (a &lt;DLE&gt;t is reported
to the software), the recording process will stop and the modem releases the
line (ATH).

<p class="bodytext"><i>
<a name="RTFToC401">Reporting
of Local Handset Status</a>
</i></p>
The modem reports the off-hook to on-hook and on-hook to off-hook transition of
the local handset by the &lt;DLE&gt;h and &lt;DLE&gt;t characters,
respectively.  The handset status is reported after the issuing of the AT#CLS=8
command and updated whenever transitions of the handset status are detected.
This handset status reporting does not depend if the modem is in Voice On-line
(VCON) mode.<p>
This is useful for auto dialer applications which need to know the handset
transitions during and after the dialing process.

Handset (#VLS=0), speakerphone (#VLS=6), or headset mode (#VLS=5) can be
selected during VoiceView mode (+FCLASS=80), when dialing is done on the
handset. The ATA command is not accepted while in VoiceView mode in accordance
with the VoiceView Protocol specification. While in VoiceView mode, the modem
can alternate between handset mode (#VLS=0) or speakerphone mode (#VLS=6)
settings for voice conversation.<p>
To terminate a call using a handset in VoiceView mode, hang up the handset. <p>
To terminate a speakerphone call in VoiceView mode, issue the ATH command.

non-zero. In order to avoid a state where speed sense is disabled (even though
the PC can crash, come back up, and try to issue commands at what should be a
supported speed), the inactivity time-out occurs if there is no data passed on
the DTE interface within the S30 period, even if the modem is on-hook. DTE
software must not select a nonzero setting for #BDR until it is ready to
establish a telephone call or virtual connection to a speaker or microphone.

RESULT CODES FOR VOICE OPERATION</a>
</b></p>
VCON	VCON is sent when the modem is configured for voice/audio (#CLS=8), or
when after answering or originating a call, the modem enters the Online Voice
Command Mode for the first time. Typically, this is immediately after an
off-hook in answer mode, and after ringback ceases in originate mode. VCON is
also sent when the DTE requests a switch from Voice Transmit Mode to Online
Voice Command Mode by issuing a &lt;DLE&gt;&lt;ETX&gt; to the modem, or when
the DTE requests a switch from Voice Receive Mode to Online Voice Command Mode
via the key abort.<p>
CONNECT	CONNECT is sent when switching from the Online Voice Command Mode to
either Voice Receive Mode via the #VRX command, or to Voice Transmit Mode via
the #VTX command. This message is sent to the DTE to inform it that it may
begin receiving or sending ADPCM or PCM data.

                            work at 38,400 bps since after start and stop bits are added,      
                            the speed increases to 36,000 bps.

#BDR=16                     The DTE knows that compression requires a 38,400 bps speed, so     
                            it forces this as the new speed. (For this example, lets say       
                            that the DTE was sending all commands, including this one, at      
                            2400 bps.)                                                         
              OK            This OK message is sent at 2400 bps, but the modem then switches   
                            to 38,400 bps. All subsequent commands are assumed to be sent at   
                            38,400 bps. If the DTE does not switch to 38,400 bps after the     
                            OK&lt;CR&gt;&lt;LF&gt;, it will not recognize the data stream coming from

#VSP=20                     The DTE changes its own speed to 38,400 bps and sends this         
                            command to set up the silence detection period for 2 seconds.      
              OK            The modem agrees. When receiving voice data, 2 seconds of          
                            silence terminates the Receive Mode. For handset operation, this   
                            amounts to a hang up.                                              
#VSS =1                     The DTE has decided to use level "1" silence detection             
                            sensitivity, meaning it is making it somewhat more difficult to    
                            delete and compress silence for the modem, but expects that when   
                            the user has hung up the handset, the silence is indeed            
                            detected. The DTE has tried to improve the quality of the          
                            message because it knows this is a handset operation. The #VSP

                            the handset, and the modem enters Online Voice Command Mode.       
                            Since this is a handset, and since the baud rate has been          
                            preselected with #BDR, this also means that DTMF detection and     
                            reporting is now enabled. The user can pick up the telephone and   
                            send tones at this point, which are delivered as shielded codes    
                            to the DTE, although the voice data is not yet being passed.       

#VRX                        This tells the modem that the DTE is ready to receive a voice      
                            message at the current compression/sampling settings.              
              CONNECT       The modem tells the DTE that it can now expect data. The modem     
                            enters Voice Receive Mode. DTMF monitoring is still enabled as     
                            well as ADPCM data flow.

                            running to ensure that the user won't speak longer than some       
                            predetermined limit. Alternatively, the DTE can require the user   
                            to enter a DTMF tone to terminate transmission of the message to   
                            the DTE.                                                           
              &lt;DLE&gt;q        The modem has noticed (#VSP time out) that the user has            
                            finished. The modem reports this while staying in Voice Receive    
                            Mode. DTMF detection and reporting is still active. The DTE now    
                            has the entire greeting message on disk.                           
              &lt;DLE&gt;*        The user has inadvertently pressed the "*" button, but the DTE     
                            is not interested in this presently.                               
!                           The DTE issues a key abort to switch to Online Voice Command       
                            Mode.                                                              
              &lt;DLE&gt;&lt;ETX&gt;<br>V  The modem exits Voice Receive Mode and switches to Online Voice

#VLS=0                      The DTE did not really have to do this, but wants to make sure     
                            that it gets no more DTMF codes from the handset. Selection of     
                            the telephone line here forces the modem out of Online Voice       
                            Command Mode, which is equivalent to hanging up.

#CLS=8                      Configure the modem for Voice Mode.                                
              OK            The modem confirms command reception, and is now set up for        
                            voice.                                                             
#VBS=4                      The DTE asks for 4-bit compression. The data from the DTE needs    
                            to travel at 38,400 bps since after start and stop bits are        
                            added, the speed increases to 36,000 bps.                          
              OK            The modem is configured for 4-bit compression (ADPCM).             
#BDR=16                     The DTE knows that compression requires a 38,400 bps speed, so     
                            it forces this as the new speed. (For this example, lets say       
                            that the DTE was sending all commands, including this one, at      
                            4800 bps.)                                                         
              OK            This OK message is sent at 4800 bps, but the modem switches to     
                            38,400 bps. All subsequent commands are assumed to be sent at      
                            38,400 bps. The DTE should switch after the &lt;CR&gt;&lt;LF&gt; following     
                            the OK. The S30 timer is now active.                               
#VLS=2                      Select the speaker as the output device to be used by the modem.   
              VCON          The modem confirms command reception, and enters Online Voice      
                            Command Mode. Since this is an output only device, nothing more    
                            can happen yet.                                                    
#VTX                        This tells the modem that the DTE is ready to send voice per the   
                            current compression/sampling settings.                             
              CONNECT       The modem tells the DTE that it can now send data. The modem       
                            enters Voice Transmit Mode and ADPCM data flow begins.             
&lt;Data&gt;                      The DTE sends data. The modem waits 1 second before starting to    
                            transmit to the speaker to ensure uninterrupted data flow. If      
                            the voice transmit buffer runs empty, the transmitter is           
                            disabled.                                                          
&lt;DLE&gt;&lt;ETX&gt;                  The DTE has finished its transmission and now instructs the        
                            modem to enter Online Voice Command Mode after emptying the        
                            voice transmit buffer.                                             
              VCON          The modem tells the DTE it is done. If the DTE sends the           
                            &lt;DLE&gt;&lt;ETX&gt; before the modem has finished transmitting all the      
                            data in its buffer, the DTE must wait for this response. (VCON     
                            indicates that the DTE can send more data at any time with #VTX.)

#CLS=8                      Configure the modem for Voice Mode. Note that the #BDR setting     
                            is assumed to be zero here, meaning that no time-out occurs        
                            forcing #CLS=0.                                                    
              OK            The modem agrees, and is now set up for voice.                     
#VBS=4                      The DTE asks for 4-bit compression for greeting message playback   
                            (ADPCM). The DTE needs to work at 38,400 bps since after start

              OK            The modem is configured for 4-bit compression.                     
#VSS =2                     Sets silence detection sensitivity to midrange.                    
              OK            The modem confirms command reception.                              
#VLS=0                      Select the telephone line as the source, ensuring that the modem   
                            is now on-hook. DTMF detection is now off regardless of the        
                            previous setting of #VLS.                                          
              OK            The modem confirms command reception, and it switches in the

#CLS=8                      Configure the modem for Voice Mode again. Although the modem has   
                            already been so configured, it is a good idea to select #CLS=8     
                            directly following a RING because in normal use, any S30           
                            time-out or hang up during Voice Mode forces #CLS=0.               
              OK            The modem agrees, and is now definitely set up for voice.

              OK            This OK message is sent at 9600 bps, but the modem then switches   
                            to 38,400 bps. All subsequent commands are assumed to be sent at   
                            38,400 bps until either another #BDR command is received or        
                            until the S30 timer expires. The S30 timer is now activated, and   
                            the default is 60 seconds.                                         
A                           The DTE tells the modem to answer.

#VTX                        The DTE does not wait for any tones, and tells the modem that it

                            sampling settings (4-bit/7200).

              OK            The modem confirms command reception                               
#VTS=#                      The DTE sends a "BEEP" to annotate its greeting message. This      
                            beep is a 1.2 second long DTMF #. During this period, the no       
                            abort is possible from the DTE, and should not be necessary.       
              OK            After the modem sends the "BEEP", it sends OK to inform the DTE    
                            that it is ready to move on. DTMF pass through is re-enabled.      
#VBS=4                      The DTE asks for 4-bit compression to recorded message. The DTE    
                            needs to work at 38,400 bps since after start and stop bits are    
                            added the speed increases to 36,000 bps.

#VRX                        The DTE instructs the modem to turn the line around and begin      
                            recording a message from the remote.                               
              CONNECT       The modem sets things up and enables ADPCM data transfer to the

              &lt;Data&gt;        ADPCM data is shipped to the DTE with shielded DTMF tones folded   
                            in. The modem is looking for silence, busy, dial tone, and loop    
                            break. The DTE records everything in its storage media.

                            to 38,400 bps. All subsequent commands are assumed to be sent at   
                            38,400 bps. The S30 timer is now active.

                            in. The modem is looking for silence, busy, dial tone, and loop    
                            break. The DTE records everything in its storage media.

                            seconds of silence. This tells the DTE that nobody is talking.     
!                           The DTE issues a key abort to switch to Online Voice Command       
                            Mode.                                                              
              &lt;DLE&gt;&lt;ETX&gt;<br>V  The modem exits Voice Receive Mode and switches to Online Voice

#CLS=0                      The DTE received no voice data, just the silence indicator after   
                            a 3.5 second wait. Since there was no calling tone and the user    
                            never entered any DTMF tones, the DTE assumes it must be a         
                            calling data modem. If the data handshake fails, the modem does    
                            not hang up the line thus giving the DTE another chance to try     
                            the fax again (in this case).                                      
              OK            The modem is now a data modem.                                     
A                           The modem pretends that it just got RING, try V.22 bis/V.42 bis,   
                            etc.

DTE to Modem  Modem to DTE  Description and Interpretation                                     
#CLS=8                      Configure the modem for Voice Mode (still ADPCM).                  
              OK            The modem agrees, and is now set up for voice.                     
#BDR=16                     The DTE knows that compression requires a 38,400 bps speed, so     
                            it forces this as the new speed.                                   
              OK            This OK message is sent at 2400 bps, but the modem then switches   
                            to 38,400 bps.                                                     
#VLS=0                      This ensures that the telephone line is selected.                  
              OK            The modem agrees.                                                  
#VRA=45                     The DTE allows 4.5 seconds for ringback to stop before assuming    
                            that the modem thinks that the remote has answered.                
              OK            The modem agrees with the DTE's assumption.                        
DT6807                      The DTE makes a telephone call, and the modem dials and goes       
                            through call progress. BUSY or NO DIALTONE can be detected, but    
                            in this example, the modem gets ringback.                          
              VCON          This message is sent 4.5 seconds after the third ringback          
                            cadence is detected by the modem. The modem is in effect           
                            assuming that the remote telephone was answered on the third       
                            ring because no fourth ringback was detected before the #VRA       
                            time-out. The modem enters Online Voice Command Mode, and DTMF     
                            and answer tone detection is enabled. (Note that during this       
                            period, the modem might have detected answer tone from a data      
                            modem. In this case, the appropriate &lt;DLE&gt; shielded code has to    
                            be sent prompting the DTE to pursue a data handshake.)             
#VTX                        The DTE has a message to send.                                     
              CONNECT       The modem says: "send it."                                         
&lt;Data&gt;                      The DTE sends the message: "Hi Dave. Your mother called."          
&lt;DLE&gt;&lt;ETX&gt;                  Procedure complete.                                                
              VCON          DTMF still active.

</p>
This appendix describes setup strings to establish commonly used
configurations.<p>
1.	Force V.42 bis data compression with LAP-M error correction.<p>
AT\N4%C2-K0<p>
2.	Force V.42 bis data compression with MNP error correction.<p>
AT\N5%C2<p>
3.	Force MNP 5 data compression with MNP error correction.<p>
AT\N5%C1<p>
<b>Note: </b>With the setup strings in examples 1-3, if the remote is unable to
negotiate the desire rate mode, the modem will disconnect and respond with NO
CARRIER.<p>
4.	Auto negotiate data compression and error correction.<p>
AT&amp;F (factory defaults) or<p>
AT\N3%C3<p>
In this mode, the modem prefers LAP-M over MNP 10, MNP 10 over MNP 4, and V.42
bis over MNP 5. If error correction is not negotiated, the modem will connect
in normal mode.<p>
